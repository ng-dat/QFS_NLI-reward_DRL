To start with, Kirsty Williams AM suggested although the Bill was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, it was still valuable to discuss in the current context. The Act had partly fulfilled the Government's objectives in regulating institutions, safeguarding contribution, managing fair access and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. Kirsty Williams AM also pointed out that new methods should be included to further regulate, co-ordinating and fund the sector. When it comes to the future of the Act, the meeting agreed that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of the civic mission, and students' interests must be fully preserved. Meanwhile, some participants argued that HEFCW's powers were inflexible and fee plans from private providers were hard to regulate. Kirsty Williams AM agreed that a more flexible connection between the regulating sectors and the others should be attained. Besides, the meeting also talked about managing risk and agreed that the Act, in the future should include more alternative providers for students who were receiving long-term support.

{"query_id": "q_train_667", "query": "What did Dr. David Blaney think of the impact of Brexit on the capacity of Wales' higher education system?", "answer": "First, the economic impact of Brexit is shown in a number of ways, like the extent to which the HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income that are located from the EU. We can also see some changes in students' applications and in increasing difficulties of the EU collaborative research activities. In terms of the financial impact, if it is accepted that the UK is a net contributor to the EU then, presumably, some of Wales' money will go straight into politics, and the benefits are unknown, which will become a matter of politics. In terms of recruitment, both European Union-domiciled applicants to Wales and non-EU international students decreased, who applied to Welsh institutions.

{"query_id": "q_train_669", "query": "According to Dr. Blaney, what are the reasons for the drop in EU students applying to study in Wales?", "answer": "He thinks there may be two reasons.  The first one is about the change in student support arrangements for EU students, which will have an effect of perturbation. Wales' institutions' fee level is slightly lower, but they do struggle in terms of the Anglocentric nature of the media and so on. The other dimension is about the attractiveness of the higher institutions in a highly competitive recruitment market.

{"query_id": "q_train_670", "query": "What does Dr. Blaney think of the reasons why prospective students should study in Wales?", "answer": "One of the reasons  is relative safety, Wales is a comfortable and safe place to be.

{"query_id": "q_train_672", "query": "How Brexit might impact the fee and access plans of the higher institutions?", "answer": "According to Mr. Blaney, there are two dimensions. Fee and access plans are approved annually by Mr. Blaney's group. They go through their financial sustainability, which is based on their forecasts and data. And also, the fee plans themselves make assumptions about how many students of different types are going to be recruited.

{"query_id": "q_train_675", "query": "What do the group think of the existing problem of Erasmus and the mobility funding for students?", "answer": "According to Bethan Owen, seven of the universities are referring to mobility, so they are including an element of it from their own income and fee and access income. However, Erasmus is such a well-established and long-term plan that to implement anything similar to it would be much less efficient and much more costly, so  replacing it would be a challenge.", "query_type": "specific", "meeting_id": "m_train_88", "relevant_text_span": [["85", "87"]]}

They're also requiring further education institutions who are regulated and deliver higher education to do similar or the same, and that's very important.", "query_type": "specific", "meeting_id": "m_train_88", "relevant_text_span": [["91", "92"]]}
{"query_id": "q_train_677", "query": "What are the other barriers to Welsh universities gaining more funding from UK research councils?", "answer": "The biggest is that there's an issue about investment. The quality of the research base in Welsh universities and the productivity of that Welsh research base are both good, there's just not enough of them. If they want to be able to play into the UK-wide research funding, the investment has two dimensions. One is having enough researchers playing in larger projects rather than small-scale projects; and the second thing is that, compared to UK-wide research pots, Wales' core research funding is not competitive.

{"query_id": "q_train_678", "query": "What are the potential difficulties after Brexit for the continuation and enhancement of researcher collaborations and networks?", "answer": "First of all, whether the Brexit deal might impact adversely on the capacity of the collaborations is still unknown. But we've mentioned playing into Horizon Europe, and being able to continue with that would be an important part of that capacity. Wales should maintain the quality, maintain the impact, and hopefully grow the critical mass.

The local authority had already chosen some locations and was already having communications with how they would then staff the centers. The local authorities were best placed to understand what was the best, pragmatic use of the resources that they had available, and of course those resources, primarily, were human beings.

Individual student circumstances could well change and their expectation would be that the Student Loans Company would respond to that. There would undoubtedly in some cases be really typical challenges to service delivery, simply because organizations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because they were reacting to social-distancing messages from the Government. They instituted a monitoring process very early on in the onset of the disease, not least because a number of institutions had campuses and activities in China and other parts of south-east Asia.

There was mainly one reason: the noise interference problem, which was too expensive to solve. Luckily, the User Interface came up with an idea to have something built into the TV that people could press and then it would send out a little signal. The Industrial Designer agreed and proposed to have a microphone by the TV speaker and a transmitter there to send back to their remotes.

Luckily, the categorization system on which they depended would continue to evolve to align itself to the curriculum reform and make changes in self-evaluation.

Since these schools were not being identified early enough, there was a need to do something urgently about these concerns, particularly in secondary schools. Even though they had identified them as needing that extra help, they were not moving at pace away from that system. In Steve's opinion, the importance lied on \"What about the schools that are sliding in that direction?\" And it brought together what they knew from Estyn, but also, local authorities had knowledge of their schools, and so did consortia.

There were just general things that happen in the life of a school that could lead to it. However, it was also right that they had a particular challenge in the secondary sector.

{"query_id": "q_train_1233", "query": "Why did they take Education through Regional Working as an example?", "answer": "In Hefin's opinion, they took ERW as an example because it did things differently with regard to the four consortia. They were interested in the effectiveness of that organization to deliver for children and for teachers since ERW had got particular challenges. What they were seeing the national consortia do is developing a national approach to school improvement services.
