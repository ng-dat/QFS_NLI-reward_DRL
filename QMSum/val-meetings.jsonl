After I just printed out a zillion of them .", "Professor E: Yeah , well , that 's  Um , so I  I do have a  a an agenda suggestion . Uh , we  I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we  we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave . So  uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around and  and uh sort of we have  anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the  the research - y kind of things . Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a  a couple weeks before um uh about the uh  the stuff you were doing with  with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events , we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by \" events \" but I think , you know , what we had meant by \" events \" I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers . But I th I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruptions with something else", "PhD D: Yeah .", "Professor E: like some other noise .", "PhD D: Uh - huh . Yeah .", "Professor E: Yes ? You mean that as an event also .", "PhD D: To", "Professor E: So at any rate you were  you 've  you 've done some work on that", "PhD D: right .", "Professor E: and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing . Um , I think especially since you  you haven't been in  in these meetings for a little bit , maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data , uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that  that uh  that uh Jane had with Lokendra uh about some  some  some um uh work about I  I  I d I  I don't want to try to say cuz I  I 'll say it wrong , but anyway some  some potential collaboration there about  about the  about the  working with these data .", "PhD C: Oh . Sure .", "Professor E: So . So , uh .", "Grad G: You wanna just go around ?", "Professor E: Uh .  Well , I don't know if we  if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing , I think there 's just just a couple  a couple people primarily um but um Uh , wh why don't  Actually I think that  that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you  you start with that .", "Postdoc B: OK . Shall I  shall I just start ? OK .", "Professor E: Yeah , just explain what it was .", "Postdoc B: Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of  you know , relating to his  to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures , and uh , the need to build in , um , this  this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language . And he gave the example in his talk about how  um , e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now , but it 's something about how um , i \" Joe slipped \" you know , \" John had washed the floor \" or something like that . And I don't have it quite right , but that kind of thing , where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence , but also the  the  the causal aspects of the uh floor and  and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it   These sorts of things . So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far ,  and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on , and um , the question was raised \" Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? \" And  and Dan Ellis said , \" Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now  we really don't need to \" . Now , how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ? So , the inferences that are involved are things like , OK , so , how do you interpret \" ahead of the game \" ? You know . So it 's the  it 's  i What you  what you int what you draw  you know , the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording ,", "Grad G: Hmm , metaphorically .", "Postdoc B: that um , i that  i we have enough space , and he continues , like \" we 're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built - in downsampling \" . So you have to sort of get the idea that um , \" ahead of the game \" is sp speaking with respect to space limitations , that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space , and that therefore we can keep the recording we 've done so far . But there are a lot of different things like that .", "Grad G: So , do you think his interest is in using this as  a data source , or  training material , or what ?", "Professor E: Well , I  I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him , so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours", "Grad G: Mm - hmm .", "Professor E: and um uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data , uh and um such things might be useful for that in or before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh , with Jane 's help , look into some of the data that we 're  already have and see , is there anything to this at all ?", "Grad G: Mm - hmm .", "Professor E: Is there any point which you think that , you know , you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it .

So that 's something I 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close uh mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation . Um , there was a  have been some nice talks recently by  by Lucent on  on their b", "PhD F: Hmm .", "Professor E: the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me , uh you know , trying and change it sample by sample , but you have some reasonable sized blocks .  And um , you know , th", "PhD A: W what is the um  the artifact you try to  you 're trying to get rid of when you do that ?", "PhD F: Ciao .", "Professor E: Uh so it 's  it  you have a  a direct uh  Uh , what 's the difference in  If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would um", "PhD F: I 'm signing off .", "Professor E: Yeah . that would subtract off  the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant . You know , so  so uh um I guess in most echo cancellation  Yeah , so you  Given that um  Yeah , so you 're trying to  So you 'd  There 's a  a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there , and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections . And if you figure out well what 's the  there 's a  a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself  adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract  essentially to subtract off uh different uh  different reflections . Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had  you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there 's a  there 's an echo . It comes back . And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo .", "PhD A: So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those . Uh , just the raw data , you would  you might hear kind of an echo ? And  and then this  noise cancellation would get", "Professor E: Well , I 'm  I 'm  I 'm saying  That 's a simplified version of what 's really happening .  What 's really happening is  Well , when I 'm talking to you right now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech , but you 're also getting , uh , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room a number of times . OK ? So now , if you um try to r you  To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons , but I  but  not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the  the room response , but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the  the effect of some of the echos . Um , a number of people have done this so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it . So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach . You say I  I  I want to use this uh  this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos . So you construct a filter , and you have this  this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh  gets subtracted off from the original speech . Then you try to  you try to minimize the energy in some sense . And so um  uh with some constraints .", "PhD A: Kind of a clean up thing , that", "Professor E: It 's a clean up thing . Right .", "PhD A: OK .", "Professor E: So , echo cancelling is  is , you know , commonly done in telephony , and  and  and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you  if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike .", "PhD A: When uh , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a um  some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise . And then it was uh  And then it would come on and it was very clear ,", "Professor E: Yeah .", "PhD A: you know .", "Professor E: Right . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights , and then it 's getting the sum . So um , uh anyway that 's  that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try  somebody look  And  and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with . I think that 'd be enough data  plenty of data to do that with , and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything . Uh .  Um", "Postdoc B: Is Brian Kingsbury 's work related to that , or is it a different type of reverberation ?", "Professor E: Brian 's  Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma . Right ? Which is what I was calling the \" party line \" , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want . We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position , and there might be , you know  There 's also um oh yeah , noise . So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise . It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays , Then we 'll figure out the right  the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those  those echos . But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted so that it 's decision about what the right  you know , right  right uh  delays are  is , uh  is  right delayed signal is  is  is  uh is incorrect . And so , in a noisy situation , um , also in a  in a situation that 's very reverberant   with long reverberation times  and really long delays , it 's  it 's sort of typically impractical . So for those kind of reasons , and also a  a c a complete inversion , if you actually  I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics . Um , that 's difficult because um often times the  the um   the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable , and so , if you  you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and  and uh goes to infinity . So it 's  so there 's  there 's  there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents  I mean there 's all sorts of  all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical . So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we  we  we sort of um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion , and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion , and um we decided to do this approach of taking  uh , just picking uh features , which were  uh will give you more  something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation , and that 's what Brian was trying to do . So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was  I was gonna bring up . Uh . Let 's see . I guess you  you actually already said this thing about the uh  about the consent forms , which was that we now don't have to  So this was the human subjects folks who said this ,  or that  that  ?", "Postdoc B: The a apparently  I mean , we 're gonna do a revised form , of course . Um but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings . She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form . I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say . So I think from a s practical standpoint , maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings , or something . It won't be that many people who do it  that often , but um just , you know , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , I guess .", "Professor E: OK . Um , back on the data thing , so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that  that we have . We have  we have an hour uh that  that is transcribed , we have  we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed , and at the rate we 're going , uh by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we  if this really uh  Well , do we have that much ?", "PhD C: Not really . It 's three to four per week .", "Professor E: Let 's see , we have", "PhD C: So that 's what  You know , that", "Professor E: uh eight weeks , uh is", "PhD C: So that 's not a lot of hours .", "Professor E: Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's  Yeah , so like thirty  thirty hours ?", "PhD A: Three  Three hours .", "PhD C: Yeah . I mean , is there  I know this sounds  tough but we 've got the room set up . Um I was starting to think of some projects where you would use well , similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close - talking mikes . There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting , that don't require any transcription . So what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ? And I 'm really interested in this  but we don't have a whole lot of data . So I was thinking , you know , we 've got the room set up and you can always think of , also for political reasons , if ICSI collected you know , two hundred hours , that looks different than forty hours , even if we don't transcribe it ourselves ,", "Professor E: But I don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester .", "PhD C: so", "Professor E: Right ? So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours .", "PhD C: I mean , is there  Are there any other meetings here that we can record , especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them  or some kind of deci I mean , that are less well  I don't  uh , that have some more emotional aspects to them , or strong", "Grad G: We had some good ones earlier .", "PhD C: There 's laughter , um I 'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings , maybe with manager types , or", "Grad G: I think it 's hard to record those .", "PhD C: To be allowed to record them ?", "Postdoc B: It 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards .", "PhD C: OK .", "Professor E: Yeah , people will get", "Postdoc B: But I  but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea .", "PhD C: OK . Well , if there is , anyway .", "Professor E: Yeah , I was gonna mention that .", "Grad G: Oh , that 's a good idea . That 's  That would be a good match .", "Professor E: Yeah . So  Yeah . So I  I  uh , I  I 'd mentioned to Adam , and  that was another thing I was gonna talk  uh , mention to them before   that uh there 's uh  It  it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media . Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data ,  that  that uh it 's just set up however they have it set up and we don't have any say about it and it 's typically one microphone , in a , uh , uh  or  and  and so it doesn't really give us the  the  the uh characteristics we want . Um and so I do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can . But um , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say \" hey you have this panel show ,  or this  you know , this discussion show , and um can you record multi - channel ? \" And uh they may be willing to record it uh with", "PhD C: With lapel mikes or something ?", "Professor E: Well , they probably already use lapel , but they might be able to have it  it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant .", "PhD C: Right .", "Professor E: It wouldn't be exactly this setup , but it would be that sort of thing , and what we were gonna get from UW , you know , assuming they  they  they start recording , isn't  als also is not going to be this exact setup .", "PhD C: Right . No , I think that 'd be great , if we can get more data .", "Professor E: So ,  I  I  I  I was thinking of looking into that . the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live ,  uh that we could invite them to have like some of their   record some of their shows here .", "Postdoc B: Wow !", "PhD C: Well  Or  The thing is , they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount I mean , they 're on the radio ,", "Grad G: Right , as we are .", "PhD C: right ? So .  Um , I think that 'd be fantastic", "Professor E: Right .", "PhD C: cuz those kinds of panels and  Those have interesting", "Professor E: Yeah .", "PhD C: Th - that 's an  a side of style  a style that we 're not collecting here , so it 'd be great .", "Professor E: And  and the  I mean , the other side to it was the  what  which is where we were coming from  I 'll  I 'll talk to you more about it later  is that  is that there 's  there 's uh the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably , uh related to , you know , legal issues and  and permissions and all that . I mean , they already do what they do  do whatever they do . So it 's  uh , it 's  So it 's  so it 's another source . So I think it 's something we should look into , you know , we 'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at UW also and um  and maybe we have this other source . But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . I mean , that was sort of our goal . The thing was , I was hoping that we could  @ @ in the  under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours . And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester . And if we continue to collect some next semester , I think we should , uh", "PhD C: Right . Yeah I was mostly trying to think , \" OK , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with .

Uh , three months from now  Um , I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing , but I think as far as the collection , it doesn't seem to me l like , uh , unreasonable to say that uh in January , you know , ro roughly uh  which is roughly three months from now , we should have at least something like , you know , twenty - five , thirty hours .", "PhD C: And we just don't know about the transcription part of that ,", "Professor E: So that 's", "Postdoc B: Yeah , we need to  I think that there 's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards ,", "PhD C: so .

I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ?", "Industrial Designer: No Nathan's fine .", "Project Manager: Good .", "Industrial Designer: It's either Nathan or participant two .", "User Interface: Mister participant two that is .", "Industrial Designer: Uh .", "Marketing: Nice .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Um ,", "Project Manager: Nice .", "Industrial Designer: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers ,", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: so  Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look  if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a um  the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .", "Project Manager: Hmm .", "Industrial Designer: So we'll have to look into that .", "Marketing: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .", "Project Manager: What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?", "Industrial Designer: Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay , brilliant .", "Industrial Designer: Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .", "Project Manager: Hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Um and just a little note there ,", "Marketing: Right .", "Industrial Designer: touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro .", "Marketing: Right . Nice .", "Industrial Designer: Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record  if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part  use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick .", "Project Manager: Hmm .", "Industrial Designer: So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .", "Marketing: Interesting .", "Industrial Designer: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that .", "Project Manager: M Maybe", "Marketing: Mm . Good call .", "Project Manager: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Choose it .", "Industrial Designer: I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course", "Project Manager: Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , just as a fun gimmick .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Just to set us apart a little bit .

Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five .", "Industrial Designer: Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?", "User Interface: Interesting question .", "Industrial Designer: 'S a bit of a challenge question .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "User Interface: Yes .", "Marketing: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Right , that's my concern too . Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is  I'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about  I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . So we're not so confined by one style and say some  you know , say our  the one", "Marketing: Right .", "Industrial Designer: if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Marketing: Right .", "Project Manager: Can we do marketing piloting too ?

Okay .", "Marketing: which actually might even come into play beforehand ,", "Project Manager: Okay , perfect .", "Marketing: it may help us decide for now . Temporarily anyway .", "Project Manager: Great , thank you very much Nathan .", "Industrial Designer: Oh yeah , you're welcome .", "Project Manager: That's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here .", "Marketing: I guess so , 'cause I found some interesting things .", "User Interface: Did you ?", "Marketing: You waiting for me ?", "Project Manager: Fascinating , compelling even .", "Marketing: I know , what a teaser ain't it . Um .  Right . So", "Marketing: current market trends . Screen . Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . Um , remote control right now  basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting  they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um  that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing .", "Marketing: Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean ,", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Marketing: v line thing may be something we can look into . Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be", "Project Manager: Tomatoes .", "Marketing: a different shape", "Marketing: or  okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of  and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy ,", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "User Interface: I like it , I like it .", "Marketing: uh not something I I've come up with a  though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something", "Industrial Designer: Hmm . I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use  we can use a rubber as part of the case ,", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: it has a consistency of those stress balls .", "User Interface: Yes .", "Marketing: Mm .", "Project Manager: Slick , slick .", "User Interface: Fabulous .", "Marketing: Might be an interesting way to go . Um , yeah so something to sit on for now .

Um . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I like the idea of of rubber too because it's  tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: 'Cause so many", "Marketing: True .", "Industrial Designer: you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls .", "Marketing: Very true .

Yeah it's just a scroll .", "Project Manager: and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So are we gonna  are we talking  we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um", "Project Manager: Well it seems like  I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um  stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um  rubber for the outside case", "Marketing: Yeah . Probably .", "Project Manager: we might as well stick with that um .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "User Interface: I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .", "Marketing: Right . Mm . Well no it's basic just like four directions that are  that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Project Manager: Mm 'kay , um .  We've already kind of covered this as well .

Yeah .", "Project Manager: That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the  thing .", "User Interface: And again copying iMac's kind of  for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme .", "Marketing: Yeah , get in there . Yeah , totally .", "Project Manager: Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on  uh multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda  yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . Cool . Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh  I'd like  Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Project Manager: And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype ,  um  using um  prototype building materials um  .", "Project Manager: And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well .", "Industrial Designer: Oh excellent yeah .", "Project Manager: So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ?", "Marketing: Cool .", "Industrial Designer: That sounds good .", "User Interface: Fabulous .", "Project Manager: Alright .

Okay , cool .", "Marketing: We're good ?", "Industrial Designer: Oh , I think mine's fallen off .", "User Interface: It fell  That's why .", "Marketing: I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee .", "Marketing: Mm .", "Marketing: Uh okay .", "User Interface: Ah .", "Project Manager: Okay ?  Right , so I'm just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick . Yeah , PowerPoint .", "Industrial Designer: Wow .", "Marketing: Very official .", "Project Manager: Yeah , well , you know ,     .", "Project Manager: Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . Right . Um . So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction , this is uh so it  right . Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . Um  We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start  talk a little bit about tool training . Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard .  Um  we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . Um I  guess you know game or something um  in real life um so yeah basically I want to  I'm just gonna  you got  of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about um  uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell .  Um so um if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , um  y is", "Marketing: You're just gonna believe me ,", "Marketing: we'll go from there .", "Project Manager: Exactly . Um I mean", "Marketing: Fair enough .", "Project Manager: obvi if if you guys  if if at the same time if you  like logically if something doesn't  like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it . I mean we'll discuss it but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like", "Marketing: Prove it", "Project Manager: yeah yeah exactly", "Marketing: yeah , okay .", "Project Manager: so , 'cause we're  what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well  um . And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to um  uh you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that , why not , you know", "Project Manager: you can  this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ?", "Industrial Designer: Oh yeah , that's fine .", "User Interface: Sure .", "Marketing: Works for me .", "Project Manager: Sweet . Cool . So I guess that that  we're totally  we're making a remote control which is thrilling", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Project Manager: um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the  in real life I dunno if you guys uh  checked the um  uh the corporate website . Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way .  Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics . And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um  um the other designer that I can't remember ,", "Project Manager: the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um  the Industrial Designer", "Project Manager: hey right on alright ,", "User Interface: Mm .", "Project Manager: getting into it um", "Marketing: There you go .", "Project Manager: to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be  you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time . And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um  I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me  tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible um to try t of sync it all up . So that's the detailed design . So it's a three stage kind of thing . Um right so for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it , I haven't tried it yet either um I'm just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around um and just write down  I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you  if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um .

Um .  This is what the finance department has told me , the C_F_O_ but I don't know , I'm not sold on this , it's pretty dear , I mean twenty f that's like you know forty bucks for a remote . It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me . Um so", "Marketing: Mm .", "Project Manager: what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it . Eur internationally . So  um one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably .

Is uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so um  and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it . Um  U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from  in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do .

Uh .", "Project Manager: yeah well it is  and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email . But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth . Um any questions , before we get started ?", "User Interface: I assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control , we can't kind of build it into other uh products .", "Project Manager: You mean to like", "User Interface: For instance like a mobile phone or something like that .", "Industrial Designer: Mm . Sounds interesting .", "Project Manager: Hmm .  Yeah .", "Marketing: I don't think there's any rules about it yet . So", "Industrial Designer: Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ?", "Project Manager: Well , have a think about it .", "Marketing: Mm .", "Project Manager: I mean", "User Interface: Yep . Okay .", "Project Manager: I'm I'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do-able", "Marketing: W yeah .", "Project Manager: isn't it .

No I mean", "Project Manager: no , good idea , good idea .

Hot .", "Marketing: I like the little cover thingies .", "Project Manager: Uh-huh y I like that", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah . That's true , I guess we we probably have some time , maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do , go back to um  I don't really have any . Let me bring up something about our basic goals here , what we want to accomplish . Uh project announcement . Ts ts ts    Yeah . Not so much .", "Marketing: Hmm .", "Project Manager: All right we'll find them , we're on our own .", "User Interface: Now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ?", "Project Manager: Yeah yeah let's do it , let's do .", "User Interface: S does anybody have any initial ideas ?", "Project Manager: I'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause", "Marketing: Good idea .

So initial ideas .", "Marketing: Well it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: right , we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things , as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: or like to have everything on one thing ,", "Marketing: but then , I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: S smaller's better .", "Marketing: you can't tell what they do .", "Industrial Designer: Simple .", "User Interface: But  I'm thinking  I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design", "Marketing: Yeah .

I mean like  stylist  yeah like a just a", "Marketing: True .", "Project Manager: yeah . Right so we got five minutes more to chat about this , perfect .

So", "Industrial Designer: So okay . It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . It's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it", "Industrial Designer: and  I don't get it .", "Marketing: Make it .", "Project Manager: Now have ten minutes to tell it .", "Industrial Designer: Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . I think it will be a few minutes and", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it  uh of it . Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you  I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I'll think about it . First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it ,", "Industrial Designer: um because its uh not so expensive . And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There's a lot of small uh electronics . So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . Now   And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here's the battery . And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That's what I said , it's very difficult .", "Industrial Designer: And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television . That's a short h uh how it works . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all  we all don't get it . My preferences ? It's uh  it won't be uh  We shouldn't make it too big . Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . We can also make uh a button uh with a   menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the TV . And on the TV you can uh switch into the menu .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: That's  I think it's easier . And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when  what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it . This is uh just uh", "Project Manager: Oh oh . Two questions .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .", "Project Manager: The battery . You say one battery is cheaper . Why ?", "Industrial Designer: If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two .", "Project Manager: Yeah but when you use two , you can use it two times longer .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting .", "Project Manager: Okay so it's the size of the remote control .", "Industrial Designer: Just  Yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay and the buttons . When you use it on the television , you've  you need the television , wh which can use it .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . But uh I think this  our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ?", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Or is it also for other company  uh for other televisions ?", "Project Manager: I think we have to use it also on other televisions though .", "Industrial Designer: Then this is an option .", "Project Manager: So", "Industrial Designer: Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we won't use the", "Project Manager: Yeah but I don't  I think it   They are two different things though . We have to choose one . It has to work on o uh all televisions .", "User Interface: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ? Okay . Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions . And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions .", "Marketing: Hmm .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: And I just uh have one more idea . Uh maybe it's one of your tasks . But  Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers . So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it .", "Marketing: Hmm .", "Industrial Designer: And also different things .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Good idea .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Marketing: Will this will this add to the cost ?", "Industrial Designer: Uh then it won't be  uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . And then you can buy the covers .", "Marketing: Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it . D does it make it more difficult to design ?", "Industrial Designer: I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Not much . 'Kay .", "Industrial Designer: Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones .", "Project Manager: Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones .", "Industrial Designer: Just one .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . If it won't works then we'll get something else . Then we uh won't g uh go further with it .", "Project Manager: Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ?", "Industrial Designer: Uh a p a   a cover made in uh in China , it it won't be I guess so expensive I think .", "Project Manager: Yeah but there are also design cost . I don't think  When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ? Would you change the cover ?", "Industrial Designer: Maybe . I wi I won't .", "Project Manager: No .", "Industrial Designer: But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and uh the the children think , oh this is my remote control , uh I made a picture on it . Uh", "Project Manager: N yeah but  I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Okay . And the other people ? What do you think about it ?", "Marketing: Um", "User Interface: Yeah it's a good idea . But  If if it  Yeah , I don't  I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea .", "Project Manager: Yes it is but I don't think we have to do it .", "User Interface: No .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: You're the Project Manager .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Yes . That's it .", "Project Manager: That's clear .  Okay thank you . So now the User Interface Designer .", "User Interface: Oh . That's me . Uh  Come on .  . Ah .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design .", "User Interface: Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh  for a remote control to to to have some influence on the TV set . Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . No cords attached . And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting . Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . Uh well the same idea here . Uh message to the television . And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh  and maybe uh teletext or something like that . Uh well these are two uh remotes , and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh  We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . Or uh uh more functions on the remote . Uh maybe more devices you can influence . Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ .  Yeah well that's our dilemma . Um any ideas about that ? Basic or multifunctional ?", "Project Manager: We'll got back on that later .", "User Interface: Okay yeah . Yeah well the  that was just on my mind .", "Marketing: Yes .", "User Interface: So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go . Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk  .", "Industrial Designer: 'Kay .", "Project Manager: 'Kay , thank you . Then it's your turn , the marketing expert .", "Marketing: Okay . Uh um m Yeah .  Um yeah okay . This bit too far .", "Marketing: So  So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . And we looked at uh several um things . Uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . Uh well what what will be our market . And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not . Well our findings . Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . Uh well they also zap a lot . So uh zapping uh should be very easy . And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . So a lot of unused buttons . There is more findings . Uh on the buttons . Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? And how much would they use them ? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection . And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . Uh not important they found the audio , uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings . Uh th and they also are not used very often . Then we have a few um graphs about the market . Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I  I think the younger will be most interest in it . But uh they are not a very big group . Um in the  we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . If you have an LCD on the remote control , what would you think of it . Now you can clearly see young users say  . I will  that would very nice . And older user think uh they will be scared of change  I think .", "Marketing: And they won't like it . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . Well here we see the same . Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . And old users not . Uh well we uh found out that there are two  several markets at which we can aim . Uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here . And um they are more critical on their money spending . Uh the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in uh new features . But uh they spend their money more easily . Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . And the second group about forty percent . So the the first group is bigger . Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . Uh yeah the first question is uh  also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . But less of them will buy it . Um well I uh   Okay . What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use , remote control . So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested . And um we can make special features . But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Um well th uh that's my second point .", "Marketing: Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . It's about discussion we had earlier . Um  You can find most functions on a TV set . So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things . Um well the design is very important . One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one . But they found most remote controls very ugly . So the design of our remote control is very important . And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that . That were my findings .", "Project Manager: Okay thank you .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . I have uh one question .", "Project Manager: Yes .", "Industrial Designer: If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like LCD or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Uh I think we don't have that in our budget .", "Marketing: Yes .", "User Interface: No .", "Industrial Designer: Do you think ?", "Marketing: No .", "User Interface: And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something .", "Industrial Designer: Like  No . No .", "User Interface: So it's  Yeah , it's hard to uh get the younger group .", "Industrial Designer: Uh-huh .", "Project Manager: I think uh the LCD is cheaper than speech recognition . So I think that can be an d good option . LCD .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm . Just the LCD ?", "Project Manager: Yes . Only the LCD .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: So  But we'll come back on that .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: Now   Oh , go on . What d d d um  Um  Uh we go   back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . So not necessary .", "Project Manager: Next . Only for the television . So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . Fourth point .  Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site .", "Project Manager: Next . Um no . We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . So  like you said , we need the   . Maybe it's good to put it in a document . Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us .", "Marketing: Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said .", "Project Manager: Sorry ?", "Marketing: The the requirements you just said ,", "Project Manager: Yes .", "Marketing: maybe we should first have a discussion about that .", "Project Manager: Yes , it's okay .", "Marketing: I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking TV can go to internet when they want to see the latest news .", "Project Manager: Yeah but we don't use it . It's a   new requirement .", "Project Manager: So , it's not my requirement .", "Industrial Designer: 'Kay , we'll just have to do that .", "Project Manager: We have to do this .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . No discussion about it .", "Marketing: Okay . Okay sorry .", "Project Manager: No .", "Marketing: Then uh", "Industrial Designer: Okay .  Unfortunately .", "Project Manager: So what controls do we need ? Who first ?", "User Interface: Well a power button ?", "Project Manager: Okay . Uh power .", "User Interface: Uh the well um I think separate channels . So", "Project Manager: Uh mm channel .", "User Interface: But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something .", "Project Manager: Channel  Zero to nine .", "User Interface: Uh volume .", "Project Manager: Volume . Maybe it's easy to pick . What was w your one ? Techno", "Marketing: Mine ? It's the functional requirements .", "Project Manager: Okay . We had w uh no no no no . Where was that example of the", "User Interface: Oh mine .", "Project Manager: Johan . That was the  the the the the", "User Interface: Technical .", "Project Manager: technical  Hallo . Okay . What do we need ? On-off . Zero to nine .", "Industrial Designer: To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down .", "Project Manager: Yeah that's the channel .", "Marketing: D Yeah . Do we make a menu ?", "Project Manager: Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . Uh", "Marketing: Uh", "Project Manager: M Menu . I think um the only one or two numbers .", "User Interface: Mm yes .", "Project Manager: And  Hello ? That's ch", "Marketing: I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection ,", "Project Manager: Yes .", "Marketing: and left-right uh for volume . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the  then to scroll through the menu and to change the options .", "Project Manager: On the LCD screen , you mean ?", "Marketing: Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the TV . Or you get the menu on the LCD screen on the remote control .", "Project Manager: Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . So", "Marketing: Yes .", "Project Manager: we need", "Industrial Designer: But then we come to the costs .", "Project Manager: N Yes . But if we have this", "Marketing: 'Kay . But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a LCD sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell .", "Project Manager: So now we don't have a lot of buttons . Is this enough ?", "User Interface: Mute .", "Project Manager: Mute . Maybe in the menu ?", "User Interface: Um", "Marketing: Mm .", "User Interface: Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do .", "Project Manager: Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Maybe more ?   No . Well . Then that's all . This will be the buttons . And  I think that's enough for the next phase .

Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . Um and it should be in there .", "User Interface: Mm . Um um wi on on a what ? Oh project project documents , yeah , yeah , yeah , okay .", "Project Manager: Project documents , yeah . So I'll put it in there .", "User Interface: Oh okay , yeah .", "Project Manager: Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ?", "User Interface: Yes , I think so .", "Project Manager: Yep . I'll do that next time . Um  I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . I just sent", "User Interface: Yeah , the last minute , yeah ,", "Project Manager: at the last minute , I'm sorry about that ,", "User Interface: yeah .", "Project Manager: but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control  that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . And we've got forty minutes to do that in . So I would say", "Industrial Designer: You said uh targ target groups ,", "Project Manager: yeah ?", "Industrial Designer: what does that mean ?", "Project Manager: As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to ,", "User Interface: Um", "Industrial Designer: Uh okay , 'kay .", "Project Manager: yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So are", "Project Manager: So we need to  yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself . So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you . Does anyone have a preference for going first ?", "Industrial Designer: Alright .  I can go first ,", "Project Manager: You wanna go first ?", "Industrial Designer: yeah .", "User Interface: Okay . Hmm .", "Project Manager: Okay , so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours .", "Project Manager: I assume we just pull it out ?", "User Interface: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Right . Um  so f from the", "Project Manager: Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we  you don't have to do it now but when  once you go back ,", "User Interface: Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay .", "Industrial Designer: Right sure .", "Project Manager: just so that I don't have to scribble everything down .", "Industrial Designer: Uh okay .   So n uh with uh with regard to the  uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um  a few basic uh components of the remote and uh  se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other .   So   this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um  in my uh role . Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and  uh from the user interface person . Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level", "Project Manager: Hmm .", "Industrial Designer: and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process .  Okay , so  these were the basic findings from today . The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . Uh I just quickly jotted them down . Um  so basically uh the  as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um  and how the parts uh communicate with each other . Um  okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the  the use for television ,  in order to keep things simple . Um  also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it  so  it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard .  Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um  there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so  I'll basic go over to the  Okay .  So  if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates  uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . There is a user interface here .  So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , um which then  so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated  to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver . Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .  Um so  i in my personal preferences um  I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um  uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions .  That's about it .  So anything that you would like to know or", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Thanks .", "Project Manager: Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ?", "Industrial Designer: No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs .", "Project Manager: Br", "Industrial Designer: Um yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay . 'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Certainly , yeah . So so tha yeah ,  we definitely need to operate within our constraints ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: but um  unfortunately I I do not have any data , so uh I just identified the functional components for that .", "Project Manager: That's fine . Are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ?", "User Interface: I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , okay .", "Project Manager: Yeah , I think that will do . Okay , so do you want to", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue", "Project Manager: Yes , shall shall we pull this up ?", "User Interface: okay , yeah .", "Project Manager: I think that has to come out of there .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Mm 'kay .", "User Interface: Thanks .", "Project Manager: Yeah , I thought those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst .", "User Interface: Oh i  Okay , I hope  wait . Should it just", "Industrial Designer: I it'll take some time .", "Project Manager: It ta takes a little  Oh , and have you", "User Interface: There's just nothing .", "Project Manager: you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight ,", "User Interface: Oh right , right , right , um", "Project Manager: so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight .", "User Interface: Okay . Nothin", "Industrial Designer: Oh , there it is , yeah .", "User Interface: okay , something is coming up .", "Project Manager: Now it's coming ,", "Industrial Designer: It'll come up , it  um uh no signal .", "Project Manager: computer no signal .", "User Interface: No signal ? Why ?", "Project Manager: Maybe again ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah , it says something now ,", "User Interface: Oh . My my computer went blank now .", "Industrial Designer: adjusting", "Project Manager: Okay , adjusting .", "User Interface: Adjusting . But  I don't see anything", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: There we go , there we go .", "User Interface: I don't see anything on my computer now .", "Industrial Designer: Oh , that's strange .", "Project Manager: Oh , if you press if you press function and that again", "User Interface: This is the problem , but", "Project Manager: there's there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "User Interface: Um  .", "Industrial Designer: And one more time .", "Project Manager: Okay , so one more time .", "User Interface: Uh now it's  okay . No ? No .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Project Manager: Should  yeah just wait for a moment , adjusting .", "User Interface: Oh okay .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Okay , that's fine , that's good . Okay , let's start from the beginning . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some  some first issues that came up . Um 'kay , so the method I was um adopting at this point , it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um  all the project but it's just at th at this very moment .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Um uh my method was um to look at um other  um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used . And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities .  And yeah , and then just to um  put the main function of the remote control in in words .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Um so the findings uh were  um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm  uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . And and also the volume is very important . Um  um  I als", "Industrial Designer: Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ?", "User Interface: okay .", "Industrial Designer: Uh switching on off channel , uh volume ,  okay , that's great .", "User Interface: 'Kay . Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm  functionalities um in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then  there are  surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . Um then   yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then  the channel numbers and then um  the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then um other functionalities um  could be just  uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um  done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: So at the  for the time being that's uh that's all .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: If you have questions", "Project Manager: If  I mean that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for  that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about .", "User Interface: Yeah , and also it's it's um  other question is uh because there are so many different  And there are so many different things that could possibly be included", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay .", "Project Manager: Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ?", "Industrial Designer: So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . Um but um  so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or  I mean in  we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that ?", "User Interface: Um well , I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use ,", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "User Interface: I mean um what other options would you have ? A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , and it'll make the costs  yeah .", "User Interface: and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly , not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other mm proposals um .", "Industrial Designer: Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an LCD display", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: and uh with um  because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . So yeah ? Cool .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm . Yep .", "Project Manager: Sure , we can discuss that maybe after the next one .", "Marketing: Cool . Do you wanna give me the little cable thing ?", "Project Manager: Do you want to  yeah .", "User Interface: Uh am I going in the right direction ?", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: No .   Wait .", "Project Manager: Oh , I'm getting hungry .", "User Interface: Okay , here it comes . Okay , here you are .", "Marketing: Cool . Ah , that's why it won't meet .  Okay , cool .", "Project Manager: You set ?", "Marketing: Yep , cool . Okay , functional requirements .", "Project Manager: Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here .", "Marketing: Alright , yeah .", "Project Manager: Hello .", "Industrial Designer: try to press", "Project Manager: Is it plugged in prop", "Industrial Designer: oh , okay ,", "Marketing: It's working .", "Project Manager: it's working ?", "Industrial Designer: yep .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: Cool , okay .", "Project Manager: Excellent .", "Marketing: So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire . Um so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . What's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and LCD screens in remote control . Not that they actually gave me any answers on the LCD screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway .", "Marketing: Um okay , so . What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .  Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control .", "Marketing: Um current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide . Um I dunno what zapping is , but", "Project Manager: It's um switching between channels , sort of randomly going through .", "Marketing: Oh , right . But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on . Um okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons ,", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Marketing: so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control ,", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Marketing: they just make it look ugly .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Marketing: Okay ? Cool . Um so this is my little graph thing .", "Project Manager: Ooh , that's a bit difficult to see .", "Marketing: Mm k", "Project Manager: If you explain it to us it'll be fine .", "Marketing: Okay , well , I can send it to all of you . What it is is um it's cones ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: 'cause I thought they'd be more exciting . Um but", "Project Manager: I liked the , I liked the litt", "Marketing: ooh where's it go ?", "Project Manager: ooh come back .", "Marketing: Back . Oh .", "Project Manager: No .", "Marketing: Oh yes , cool . Okay , I'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Um okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm , that's the next one along , yeah ?", "Marketing: Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance , you know ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: so on a scale of one to ten , how important is that", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , although I don't understand how it couldn't be ,", "Marketing: um and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used . Okay .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing .  Okay , cool . So um okay , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . Uh that they get lost , that the uh you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: I think if you're watching enough TV to get repetitive strain injury from um you know , watching TV , then  that's the least of your problems ,", "Project Manager: The remote control .", "Marketing: but you know ,  it's up there .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Marketing: Um that  yeah . Okay , so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Marketing: you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching TV  .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Marketing: Yes . Okay , cool . Right , um sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I didn't have time to white it out again .", "Project Manager: That's alright .", "Marketing: Um okay , but that shows how people  whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite  are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it . Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a TV , you know , tends to be people talking and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching TV .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Marketing: Um okay ? Cool . Um okay , so these are my personal preferences .  So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool . Um you know , functional , so it's useful , but minimalist . Um there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both .", "Industrial Designer: Mm . Mm .", "Marketing: Um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and um , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit .", "Marketing: Um and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Marketing: not a mobile phone", "Industrial Designer: Some kind of a ring ,", "Project Manager: Keys and things like that ,", "Industrial Designer: some", "Marketing: Yeah , that's it , you know .", "Project Manager: yeah . Whistle and it  screams at you , yeah .", "Marketing: I know , it's weird . My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything .", "Marketing: So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something   a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the TV , you know ,", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes ,", "Marketing: 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Marketing: So okay ? Cool . That's me .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , that's great ,", "Project Manager: That's you , excellent .", "User Interface: Um that's very good ,", "Industrial Designer: thanks .", "Project Manager: Um .", "User Interface: very interesting .", "Project Manager: I'm just gonna tick yes . So , we've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss", "Industrial Designer: Mm .  I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um  uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um  uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people .", "Marketing: Cat's . Ca  .", "Industrial Designer: So if we need to have a target group um then uh  I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and uh you know , good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know , people who are comparatively elderly . Um .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Yeah , I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control ,", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Marketing: but I'm assuming , you know , yes .", "Industrial Designer: Right .

Yeah .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah , but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check .", "Industrial Designer: yeah .", "Project Manager: Um , so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money ,", "User Interface: Yeah but uh um  Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah .", "Project Manager: then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: I don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls .", "User Interface: Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons", "Project Manager: Yeah ,", "User Interface: and um , yeah it's it's kind of safer , so we we need both ,", "Industrial Designer: Mm . W", "Project Manager: I think we need both .", "Industrial Designer: What uh", "User Interface: so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: What wh uh  what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on TV and how they are numbered on the remote control .

Uh-huh .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , so if uh if something like that can be incorporated ,", "Marketing: Yeah , that would be another way to do it .", "Project Manager: So that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great .", "Industrial Designer: some kind of", "Marketing: Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because  I mean Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: so then it would be  you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky .", "Project Manager: Watch Sky and  yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Alright .", "Marketing: Yeah , yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , that's", "Marketing: and that would be really annoying .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm . But that's definitely a possibility .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "User Interface: Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't  as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: and and the TV would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there .", "Marketing: Yeah . Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ?", "Project Manager: So that you can yell at it ,", "Marketing: Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control .", "Project Manager: yeah .", "Marketing: It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it  and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Alright .", "User Interface: Yeah , but then the remote control I think  I mean  um the idea is kind of  it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself .", "Marketing: Yeah , yeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then", "Industrial Designer: Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control", "Project Manager: Mm . Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: being cl I mean it'll it'll  mm .", "User Interface: No , but I I I was just defending the  the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .

Okay , I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um . But if we go away with that that kind of general um  specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option", "User Interface: The major ones , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Project Manager: um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email .

Yep .", "Project Manager: F_ five .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Uh-huh hmm okay .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm .", "Marketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way", "Marketing: because they are supposed to be useful .  Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly .  Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were  people are ready to pay for nice and look  and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in  and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it  the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please .  Now  people are very frustrated w with their  remote controls", "Marketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it", "Marketing: it's  it's often lost somewhere in the in the  in your home and nobody knows where it is .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: Agree .", "Marketing: Maybe if we have something where we could  ask the remote control please , where are you ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Like uh something to to  like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone", "Marketing: but  you can't phone your  your remote control .", "Industrial Designer: You can  you are  .", "Project Manager: Why not ?", "Marketing: But why not ? Yeah .", "Marketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use ,", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Marketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to  they  to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .", "Project Manager: Okay uh tha that's look great .", "Marketing: So I think they are bad .", "User Interface: R_S_I_ mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm . Mm nobody has any idea about that ? Well I'll check uh with my", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect .", "Marketing: Oh , okay ,", "User Interface: No , I don't think so .", "Marketing: I think it's a technical thing", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ,", "Marketing: which our", "Industrial Designer: because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .

Yeah .", "Marketing: what else do I have ? Next slide ? Ah yeah .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: So we've listed a couple of uh", "User Interface: Functions .", "Marketing: s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you  use it only once per session , but it is very relevant .", "Marketing: People want to have a power button . Channel selection is uh o often used  very often used and indeed uh very relevant .", "Marketing: Ah  now I remember what is R_S_I_", "Marketing: it's repetitivity stress injury .  We have to be careful with that word but  uh anyway", "Industrial Designer: Uh .", "Marketing: I continue my presentation so  yeah ,", "Marketing: channel selection is um very important , very often used . Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . All of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant .

For instance I think  net next slide .  One of the thing  the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility  the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . And uh as the age goes up  the  the relevance goes down .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ?", "Industrial Designer: 'Cause", "Marketing: I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they  this should be so now", "Project Manager: Mm-mm . Okay .", "Marketing: this is of course , depends on that . And um I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . And uh , if you have any question ?", "Project Manager: Mm I think it's good , okay . You done a good review .", "User Interface: I got one question ,", "Marketing: I can go back .", "Industrial Designer: Thank you .", "Marketing: Yeah one question ,", "User Interface: uh you are a Market Expert", "Marketing: yeah ?", "User Interface: so", "Marketing: I am .", "User Interface: should we aim at the young people or not ?", "Marketing: I think we should aim at the young people .

Yeah .", "Marketing: I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: Although I don't know .", "User Interface: Alright ? Thanks for your attention .", "Project Manager: Uh you're finish ? Okay . So now  the technical aspects of this new device . Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Two . Yeah , if   Sorry .", "Project Manager: You prefer it  .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh  like digital calculators and electronic calculators .  So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like TV or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like TV . So we need to have some energy source to do what  to do the functions , what we want on this portable device .  And usually this  so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages  these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device  remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are  I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different TVs ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: so some TVs will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things .", "Project Manager: Okay . To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the TV device . So we need to have particular encryption codes .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you  can you make it on the whiteboard , or  mm .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface  speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .

Yeah . OK so , let 's get started . Nancy said she 's coming and that means she will be . Um . My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures uh to start . So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh , uh , actually from uh DFKI uh , part of the German SmartKom project , who were here for the week and , I think got a lot done .", "Grad E: Yeah , I think so too . Um . The  we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like \" Roman numeral one , am Smarticus . \" It actually says , \" Roemisch einz , am Smarticus , \"", "Grad B: OK .", "Grad E: which means it 's just using a German sythesis module for English sentences .", "Grad B: OK .", "Grad E: So uh ,", "Professor C: It doesn't know \" I \" .", "Grad B: OK .", "Grad E: Um , the uh", "Grad B: Oh , Am Spartacus . \"", "Grad D: \" I am Sm - I am Smarticus \" is what it 's saying .", "PhD A: Right .", "Grad B: Verstehe . OK .", "Grad D: I gue", "Grad E: The uh sythesis is just a question of um , hopefully it 's just a question of exchanging a couple of files , once we have them . And , um , it 's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech approach . So I 'm  I 'm  I 'm going backwards now , so \" synthesis \" is where you sort of make this  uh , make these sounds , and \" concept to speech \" is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said , and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce things better , presumably . Then , just with text to speech .", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "Grad E: And , uh , Johno learned how to write XML tags . Uh , and did write the tree adjoining grammar for some  some sentences . No , right ?", "Grad D: Yeah .", "Grad E: Yeah , for a couple", "Grad D: So . Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , to a  er in XML and there 's a conversion system for different uh , to go from XML to something else . And th so , the knowledge base for the system , that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , in a LISP - like  the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form . And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on Prolog . So , you have a  basically , a goal and it , you know , says \" OK , well I 'm gonna try to do the Greet - the - person goal ,", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "Grad D: so it just starts  uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold . Basically , it just means \" build the tree . \"", "Grad B: OK .", "Grad D: And then it passes the tree onto , uh , the ge the generation module .", "Grad E: But I think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterances that the German system can do , we 've already written the  the syntax trees for three or four .", "Grad D: We yeah . So , the syntax trees are very simple . It 's like most of the sentences in one tree ,", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "Grad D: and instead of , you know , breaking down to , like , small units and building back up , they basically took the sentences , and basically cut them in half , or you know , into thirds or something like that , and made trees out of those . And so uh , uh Tilman wrote a little tool that you could take LISP notation and generate an XML , uh , tree . Uh , S what do ca structure from the  from the LISP . And so basically you just say , you know , \" noun goes to \" , you know , Er , nah , I don't re I 've never been good at those . So there 's like the VP goes to N and those things in LISP , and it will generate for you .", "Grad B: OK . N , N , V yeah , OK . Alright .", "Grad E: And because we 're sticking to that structure , the synthesis module doesn't need to be changed . So all that f fancy stuff , and the Texas speech version of it , which is actually the simpler version , is gonna be done in October which is much too late for us . So . This way we  we worked around that . The , uh  the system , um  I can show you the system . I actually want , at least , maybe , you should be able to start it on your own . If you wanna play around with it , in th in the future . Right now it 's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes on  on  on  on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything . And send in a  a  a couple of side queries on some dummy center set - up program so that it actually works because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition running with this s Siemens virtual touch screen , which we don't have here .", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "Grad E: And so we 're doing it via mouse , but the whole system was designed to work with this thing and it was  It was a lot of engineering stuff . No science in there whatsoever , but it 's working now , and um , that 's the good news . So everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation .", "Grad D: Why  I had  I did need to chan generate different trees than the German ones , mainly because you know like uh , the gerund in  in German is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb ,", "Grad E: You have to switch it on .", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "Grad D: so I 'd uh have to add \" am walking , \"", "Grad B: OK .", "Grad D: or I 'd have to add a little stem for the \" am \" , when I build the  built the tree .", "Grad B: OK .

OK .", "Professor C: So it 's just , uh in the sam same actually with the rest of us we just need to really understand what 's there . Is there anything we can make use of ?

Oh OK .", "Professor C: And , so The idea is there 's this uh , other subgroup that 's worrying about formalizing the nota getting a notation .

Yeah . Yeah .", "Grad B: and then that 's going to go away pretty soon .", "Professor C: But  but we we 're swit", "Grad B: OK .", "Professor C: Right .", "Grad B: And then we 'll sort of shift gears a Fairly substantially ,", "Professor C: Yeah .", "Grad E: It 's", "Professor C: Yeah .", "Grad B: huh ?", "Professor C: Yeah .", "Grad E: It 's got .

OK .", "Professor C: So , c sh we could set that up as actually an institute wide thing ?

OK . Makes sense .", "Professor C: But any so that  e e It 's clear , then , I think . Actually , roughly starting uh let 's say , nex next meeting , cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report .", "Grad B: Yeah . OK .", "Professor C: But uh starting next meeting I think we want to flip into this mode where  Uh . I mean there are a lot of issues , what 's the ontology look like ,", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "Professor C: you know what do the constructions look like , what 's the execution engine look like , mmm lots of things .", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "Professor C: But , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out . Now before we do that , let 's get back in  Oh ! But , it 's still , I think , useful for you to understand the demo version enough , so that you can  can see what  what it is that  that uh it might eventually get retro - fitted into or something .", "Grad B: Yeah . OK , right .", "Professor C: And Johno 's already done that , uh , looked at the dem uh the  looked at the SmartKom stuff .", "Grad D: Wa uh  To some de uh what  what part of th the SmartKom stuff ?", "Professor C: Well , the parser , and that stuff .", "Grad D: Oh yeah  yeah .", "Professor C: OK . Anyway . So , the trip  the report on these  the last we we sort of interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week .", "Grad B: Yeah . It 's alright .", "Grad E: Um .  Well it was just amazing to  to see uh how  how instable the whole thing is ,", "Professor C: Maybe you 're done , then .", "Grad E: and if you just take the  And I g I got the feeling that we are  the only ones right now who have a running system . I don't know what the guys in Kaiserslautern have running because e the version  that is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work . And you need to do a lot of stuff to make it work . And so it 's  And even Tilman and Ralf sort of said \" yeah there never was a really working version that uh did it without th all the shortcuts that they built in for the uh October @ @ version \" . So we 're actually maybe ahead of the System Gruppe by now , the system  the integration group . And it was , uh  It was fun to some extent , but the uh the outcome that is sort of of scientific interest is that I think both Ralf and Tilman  um , I know that they enjoyed it here , and they r they  they liked , uh , a lot of the stuff they saw here , what  what we have been thinking about , and they 're more than willing to  to um , cooperate , by all means . And um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal \" group - ware \" server at EML , make that open to all of us and them , so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and  and generating and constructions w we  we sort of uh put it in there and they put what they do in there and maybe we can even um , get some overlap , get some synergy out of that . And um , the , uh  If I find someone at  in EML that is interested in that , um I  I may even think that we could look  take constructions and  and generate from them because the tree adjoining grammars that  that Tilman is using is as you said nothing but a mathematical formalism . And you can just do anything with it , whether it 's syntactic trees , H P S G - like stuff , or whether it 's construction . So if you ever get to the generation side of constructing things and there might be something of interest there , but in the moment we 're of course definitely focused on the understanding , um , pipeline .", "Professor C: Anyth - any other   uh repo visit reports sort of stories ? uh we  so we now know I think , what the landscape is like .", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "Professor C: And so we just push on and  and uh , do what we need to do . And one of the things we need to do is the um , and this I think is relatively tight  tightly constrained , is to finish up this belief - net stuff . So . Uh . And I was going to switch to start talking about that unless there 're m other more general questions . OK so here 's where we are on the belief - net stuff as far as I understand it . Um . Going back I guess two weeks ago uh Robert had laid out this belief - net , missing only the connections . Right ? That is   So , he 'd put all th all the dots down , and we went through this , and , I think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there . Yeah  we may run across one or two more . But of course the connections weren't . So , uh Bhaskara and I went off and looked at some technical questions about were certain operations sort of legitimate belief - net computations and was there some known problem with them or had someone already uh , solved you know how to do this and stuff . And so Bhaskara tracked that down . The answer seems to be uh , \" no , no one has done it , but yes it 's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that 's what you set out to do \" . And , so the current state of things is that , again , starting now , um we 'd like to actually get a running belief - net for this particular subdomain done in the next few weeks . So Bhaskara is switching projects as of the first of June , and uh , he 's gonna leave us an inheritance , which is a uh  hopefully a belief - net that does these things . And there 're two aspects to it , one of which is , you know , technical , getting the coding right , and making it run , and uh stuff like that . And the other is the actual semantics . OK ? What all  you know , what are the considerations and how and what are the ways in which they relate . So he doe h he doesn't need help from this group on the technical aspects or if he does uh we 'll do that separately .", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "Professor C: But in terms of what are the decisions and stuff like that , that 's something that we all have to work out . Is  is that right ? I mean that 's  that 's both you guys ' understanding of where we are ?", "Grad E: Absolutely .", "Professor C: OK .", "Grad G: So , I guess , um  Is there like a latest version of the belief - net  of the proposed belief - net ? Like", "Grad E: We had um decided", "Grad G: like", "Grad E: Um . Well , no , we didn't decide . We wanted to look into maybe getting it , the visualization , a bit clearer , but I think if we do it , um , sort of a paper version of all the nodes and then the connections between them , that should suffice .", "Grad G: Mm - hmm . Yeah , that should be fine .", "Professor C: Yeah I mean , that 's a separate problem .", "Grad D: Yeah , I", "Professor C: We do in the long run wanna do better visualization and all that stuff .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Professor C: That 's separable , yeah .", "Grad D: I did look into that , uh in terms of , you know , exploding the nodes out and down ag", "Professor C: Yep . Right .", "Grad D: JavaBayes does not support that . I can imagine a way of hacking at the code to do that . It 'd probably take two weeks or so to actually go through and do it ,", "Professor C: Not  not at this point .", "Grad D: and I went through all the other packages on Murph - Kevin Murphy 's page ,", "Professor C: Right .", "Grad D: and I couldn't find the necessary mix of free and uh with the GUI and , with this thing that we want .", "Professor C: Well , we can p If it 's  If we can pay  Yeah . If you know it 's paying a thousand dollars or something we can do that . OK ? So  so don't view free as  as a absolute constraint .", "Grad D: OK . OK , so then I 'll go back and look at the ones on the list that", "Professor C: OK . And you can ask Kevin .", "Grad E: But", "Grad G: Yeah .", "Grad D: Mmm .", "Grad E: But", "Grad G: Yeah , the one that uh people seem to use is uh Hugin or whatever ?", "Professor C: Hugin , yeah that 's free .", "Grad G: How exp I don't think it 's  Is it free ? Because I 've seen it advertised in places so I  it seems to", "Professor C: Uh , it may be free to academics . Like I  I don't know . I have a co  I have a copy  that I l I downloaded .", "Grad G: OK .", "Professor C: So , at one point it was free .", "Grad G: OK .", "Professor C: Uh but yo I noticed people do use Hugin so um ,", "Grad D: How do you spell that ?", "Professor C: HUGIN .", "Grad F: Why", "Professor C: And Bhaskara can give you a pointer . So then , in any case , um  But paying a lit You know , if i if it 's uh  Probably for university , it 's  it 's gonna be real cheap anyway . But um , you know , if it 's fifty thousand dollars we aren't gonna do it . I 'm mean , we have no need for that .", "Grad E: I  I also s would suggest not to d spend two weeks in  in  in changing the  the JavaBayes code .", "Professor C: No ,", "Grad B: Yeah .", "Professor C: he 's not gonna do that .", "Grad D: OK .", "Grad E: I  I will send you a pointer to a Java applet that does that , it 's sort of a fish - eye . You  you have a node , and you click on it , and it shows you all the connections ,", "Grad D: Mmm .", "Grad E: and then if you click on something else that moves away , that goes into the middle . And maybe there is an easy way of interfacing those two . If that doesn't work , it 's not a problem we  we need to solve right now . What I 'm  what my job is , I will , um , give you the input in terms of  of the internal structure . Maybe node by node , or something like this ? Or should I collect it all", "Grad G: Mm - hmm .", "Grad E: and", "Professor C: Doesn't matter .", "Grad G: Um , just any like  like sort of rough representation of the entire belief - net is probably best .", "Grad E: OK . And um you 're gonna be around ? t again , always Tuesdays and Thursdays afternoon - ish ? As usual ? Or will that change ?", "Grad G: Yeah  I mean , yeah , I can  like I c Um . This week I guess um , kind of  I have a lot of projects and stuff but after that I will generally be more free . So yes , I might  I can be around . And g I mean , generally if you email me also I can be around on other days .", "Grad E: Yeah . OK .", "Professor C: Yeah and this is not a crisis that  I mean , you do , e everybody who 's a student should , you know do their work , get their c courses all in good shape and  and  and  and then we 'll dig  d dig down on this .", "Grad E: Yeah , that 's  Yeah . OK . No , that 's good . That means I have I h I can spend this week doing it . So .", "Grad G: OK .", "Grad B: How do you go about this process of deciding what these connections are ? I know that there 's an issue of how to weight the different things too , and stuff . Right ? I mean do you just sort of guess and see if it sort of", "Professor C: Right . Well there  there  there There 're two different things you do .", "Grad E: It 's", "Professor C: One is you design and the other is you learn . OK ? So uh what we 're gonna do initially is  is do design , and , i if you will , guess .", "Grad B: OK .", "Professor C: OK . Uh that is you know use your best knowledge of  of the domain to uh , hypothesize what the dependencies are and stuff .", "Grad B: Right . OK .", "Professor C: If it 's done right , and if you have data then , there are techniques for learning the numbers given the structure", "Grad B: Yeah .", "Professor C: and there are even techniques for learning the structure , although that takes a lot more data , and it 's not as @ @ and so forth and so on . So uh but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise I think we 'll just design it .", "Grad B: Alright .", "Grad E: Yeah . Fo - Hopefully as time passes we 'll get more and more data from Heidelberg and from people actually using it and stuff .", "Grad B: OK .", "Grad E: So but this is the     long run .", "Grad B: Yeah .", "Grad E: But to solve our problems ag uh a mediocre design will do I think in the beginning .", "Grad B: Yeah , that 's right . Yeah , oh , and by the way , speaking of data , um , are there I could swore  uh , I could swear I saw it sitting on someone 's desk at some point , but is there a  um a transcript of any of the , sort of , initial interactions of people with the  with the system ? Cuz you know , I 'm still sort of itching to  to look at what  look at the stuff , and see what people are saying .", "Professor C: Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah make yourself a note . So and  and , of course Keith would like the German as well as the English , so whatever you guys can get .", "Grad E: The German . Oh yeah , of course , German . Yeah .", "Professor C: Yeah , the y your native language , right ? You remember that one .", "Grad E: OK . That 's important , yeah .", "Grad B: Yeah ,", "Professor C: So he 'll get you some data .", "Grad B: u OK . Yeah , I mean I  I sort of um found the uh , uh the audio of some of those , and um , it kind of sounded like I didn't want to trudge through that , you know .", "Grad E: Hmm .", "Grad B: It was just  Strange , but .", "Professor C: Yep .", "Grad E: We probably will not get those to describe because they were trial runs .", "Grad B: Oh yeah , OK .", "Grad E: Um , but uh that 's th but we have data in English and German already .", "Grad B: OK , yeah , I mean .", "Grad E: So .  Transcribed . I will send you that . OK .", "Professor C: OK , so while we 're still at this sort of top level , anything else that we oughta talk about today ?", "Grad E: Ho - how was your thingy .", "Grad B: Oh , um , I just wanted to , uh , s like mention as an issue , um , you know last meeting I wasn't here because I went to a linguistics colloquium on the fictive motion stuff ,", "Professor C: Oh right .", "Grad B: and that was pretty interesting and you know , I mean , seems to me that that will fairly obviously be of relevance to uh  to what we 're doing here because you know people are likely to give descriptions like you know , \" What 's that thing uh right where you start to go up the hill , \" or something like that , you know , meaning a few feet up the hill or whatever from some reference point and all that stuff so I mean , I 'm sure in terms of you know , people trying to state locations or , you know , all that kind of stuff , this is gonna be very relevant . So , um , now that was  the talk was about English versus Japanese , um , which obviously the Japanese doesn't affect us directly , except that , um , some of the construction  he 'd  what he talked about was that you know in English we say things like th you know , \" your bike is parked across the street \" and we use these prepositional phrases , you know , \" well , if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike \" , but um in  in Japanese the  the more conventionalized tendency is to use a  sort of a description of \" where one has crossed to the river , there is a tree \" . Um , and you know , you can actually say things like , um , \" there 's a tree where one has crossed the river , but no one has ever crossed the river \" , or something like that . So the idea is that this really is you know that 's supposed show that 's it 's really fictive and so on . But um  But the point is that that kind of construction is also used in English , you know , like \" right where you start to go up the hill \" , or \" just when you get off the train \" , or something like that to  uh , to indicate where something is .", "Professor C: Mmm .", "Grad B: So we 'll have to think about", "Professor C: So  how much is that used in German ?", "Grad E: Um . The uh  Well  I wa I was on a uh  on a  on a different sidetrack .", "Professor C: Oh , OK .", "Grad E: I mean , the  the Deep Map project which um is undergoing some renovation at  at the moment , but this is a  a three language project : German , English , Japanese .", "Grad B: OK .", "Grad E: And um , we have a uh , uh  I have taken care that we have the  the Japanese generation and stuff . And so I looked into uh spatial description . So we can generate spatial descriptions , how to get from A to B . And  and information on objects , in German , English , and Japanese .", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "Grad E: And there is a huge uh project on spatial descriptions uh  differences in spatial descriptions . Well , if yo if you 're interested in that , so how  how , I mean it does sort of go d all the way down to the conceptual level to some extent .", "Grad B: OK .", "Grad E: So . Um .", "Professor C: So , where is this huge project ?", "Grad E: It 's KLEIST . It 's the uh Bielefeld generation of uh spatial descriptions and whatever .", "Professor C: Mm - hmm .", "Professor C: Well , that may be another thing that Keith wants to look at .", "Grad B: OK .", "Grad E: But um , I  I think we should leave Japanese constructions maybe outside of the scope for  for now ,", "Grad B: Yeah .", "Grad E: but um definitely it 's interesting to look at  at cross the bordered there .", "Professor C: Mm - hmm .", "PhD A: Are  are you going to p pay any attention to the relative position  of  of the direction relative  relative to the speaker ? For example , there are some differences between Hebrew and English . We can say um \" park in front of the car \" as you come beh you drive behind the car .

And so we think  we think we have a shot at  at that .", "Grad B: OK .", "Professor C: So . The for So . To  to come full circle on that , this formalization task , OK ? is trying to get the formalism into  into a shape where it can actually uh", "Grad B: Yeah . Be of use to someone who 's trying to do this , right ?", "Professor C: d Well , yeah , where it actually is  is  covers the whole range of things . And the  the  the  the thing that got Mark into the worst trouble is he had a very ambitious thing he was trying to do , and he insisted on trying to do it with a limited set of mechanisms . It turned out , inherently not to cover the space .", "Grad B: OK .", "Professor C: And it just  it was just terribly frustrating for him ,", "Grad B: Yeah .", "Professor C: and he seemed fully committed to both sides of this i i irreconcilable thing .", "Grad B: I see . Right .", "Professor C: And . Uh . Johno is much more pragmatic .", "Grad B: OK . Good to know .", "Professor C: Uh . Huh ? Is  This is true , is it not ?", "Grad D: Yes .", "Professor C: OK . So there 's you know sort of , yeah , deep , really deep , emotional commitment to a certain theory being uh , complete .", "Grad B: Oh , OK .", "Grad F: You don't have a hidden purist streak ?", "Grad D: Oh no .", "Professor C: We - well it hasn't it  it certainly hasn't been observed , in any case .", "Grad F: OK . Just checking .", "Grad D: No sir .", "Grad B: Alright .", "Professor C: Um . Now , you do , but that 's OK . Uh . So . For  for", "Grad B: Cuz I don't have to implement anything .", "Professor C: Exactly right . Exactly .", "Grad F: I have a problem , then . It 's  So . Whether I do depends on whether I 'm talking to him or him probably .", "PhD A: Hmm .", "Grad B: Yeah , right .", "Professor C: Right . Why  a actually , uh , the thing is , you  you do but , th the thing you have to im implement is so small that  Uh .", "Grad F: Which meeting I 'm in . It 's OK to be purist within that context .", "Professor C: Within that , yeah ,", "Grad F: Yes ,", "Professor C: and uh , it 's  a and still , I think , you know , get something done .", "Grad F: good .", "Grad B: Cool !", "Professor C: But to try to do something upscale and purist Particularly if  if um what you 're purist about doesn't actually work ,  is real hard .", "Grad F: Yay .", "Grad B: Mm - hmm . Yeah .", "Professor C: OK . And then the other thing is while we 're doing this uh Robert 's gonna pick a piece of this space ,", "PhD A: It 's possible yeah .", "Grad B: OK .", "Professor C: OK , uh , for his absentee thesis . I think you all know that  that you can just , in Germany  almost just send in your thesis .", "Grad B: Just a drive up . Ca - chuk !", "PhD A: Um", "Professor C: Yeah right .", "Grad B: There you go .", "Professor C: OK .", "Grad E: The - th There  there 's a drive - in thesis uh sh  joint over in Saarbruecken .", "Grad B: Exactly . Drive through , yeah .", "Professor C: It costs a lot . The  the amount  You put in your credit card and   as well . But , uh ,  But anyway , so , uh , that 's um , also gotta be worked out , hopefully over the next few weeks , so that  that it becomes clear uh , what piece uh , Robert wants to jump into . And , while we 're at this level , uh , there 's at least one new doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project , either next week or the first of August , depending on the blandishments of Microsoft .", "Grad B: OK .", "Professor C: So , de Uh .

So we 'll see how this goes . Oh there 's yet another one of the incoming first   incoming first - year graduate students who 's expressed interest , so we 'll see how that goes . Um , anyway , so , I think as far as this group goes , um , it 's certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts . We 'll see whether it 's gonna make sense to have this be separate from the other bigger effort with the formalization stuff or not , I 'm not sure .

Uh . I  I think the one you  you gave here a couple of weeks ago would be of interest there , too .", "PhD A: Sure , yeah .", "Professor C: A lot of interest . Actually , either place , DFKI or uh  Yeah , so , and  and if there is a book , that you 'll be building up some audience for it .", "PhD A: Yeah . Right .", "Professor C: And you 'll get feedback from these guys .", "PhD A: Great , yeah .", "Professor C: Cuz they 've actually  these DFKI guys have done as much as anyone over the last decade in trying to build them .

So , how about if you two guys between now and next week come up with something that is partially proposal , and partially questions , saying \" here 's what we think we understand , here are the things we think we don't understand \" .

No .", "Grad D: Nnn . This  Well , I 've  I have projects , but then the  my prof professor of one of my classes also wa has a final that he 's giving us .

So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use  traditional solar cells or  mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_", "Marketing: Ah .", "Industrial Designer: and then uh titanium , which can be  which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d LCD display . And we can use some  , moving  kind of thing . So , as we discussed before , we need to  we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and  which can use microphone  sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to  in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm , okay .", "Industrial Designer: So uh we discussed an   Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: and so we would like to just use simple battery .

Hand light ,", "Marketing: Mm  glow in the dark ,", "User Interface: yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah", "Marketing: so", "Industrial Designer: maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: so that like  at least um", "Project Manager: Iradium ?", "Industrial Designer: yeah .", "User Interface: Okay . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ,", "Project Manager: Ah sorry . Mm .", "Industrial Designer: that", "Project Manager: Okay . So mm", "User Interface: Okay . S well ,", "Marketing: Okay .", "User Interface: let's go on maybe with the presentation .", "Marketing: Yeah . Uh-huh , yeah sure .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: And um the remote control's going to be smart", "Industrial Designer: Oh .", "User Interface: but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ?", "User Interface: And uh", "User Interface: I dunno", "User Interface: that's a question to you and to mm to", "Marketing: Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the smartness of the thing .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition", "Marketing: but we may have remote controls with speech recognition .", "User Interface: Okay , okay .", "Marketing: I dunno .", "Project Manager: Mm , that's a nice world .", "User Interface: So just just just just think about it um .", "User Interface: Thank you .", "Marketing: Don't touch the remote .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: But  yeah . Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want .", "User Interface: Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart .", "Marketing: Like with some  Maybe fingerprint recognition or", "User Interface: Voice recognition is quite tough . I say don't use it , and the control just looks .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Mm .", "User Interface: 'Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it .", "Marketing: Um  Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Uh that  mm that could be feasible I guess , like  So since we have  we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use", "Marketing: Okay . So it could be smart in that way .", "Industrial Designer: yeah . Yeah , yeah .", "Project Manager: Mm . Okay .", "Marketing: But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh  things like that", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "User Interface: Yeah , sure .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: I dunno , that might be expensive", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: but", "Industrial Designer: Uh it's", "Marketing: that might also be a good sales pitch again .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "Marketing: The remote that knows you .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Okay , thanks .", "Project Manager: So it's", "Marketing: My turn ?", "Project Manager: yeah , Marketing Expert .", "Marketing: Okay , it's alright .", "Project Manager: Participant two ?", "Industrial Designer: Four .", "Project Manager: Four ,", "Marketing: Four , I think .", "Project Manager: sorry .", "Marketing: Trend , yeah . No uh yes . Okay , so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . So , next slide please . So first maybe just a small recap on  how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple . Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people  have with them , always , like a phone . We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh  example of where to in be inspired . Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also  have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . I hope I'm going to try to help you on that . This is more risky because you're not following the trend ,", "Marketing: you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business .", "Marketing: So anyway uh next slide please .  Uh to be to be quick  there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are  uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very  pay much attention to . The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy . Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative ,", "Marketing: it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . So as you see uh  it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control .", "Marketing: Next slide please .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Marketing: Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so  currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of  of look or feel", "Marketing: or so .", "Marketing: And I think of course uh  i it applies to everything . That's the thing with trends .  It it can travel f from clothe to furniture  same idea .", "Marketing: Fruit and vegetable . Think fruit and vegetable .  And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy ,", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "User Interface: What is spongy ?", "Marketing: yeah . Well", "Industrial Designer: Yeah", "Marketing: this  so so I think uh uh i", "Industrial Designer: kind of um maybe", "Marketing: When we were talking about rubber ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah it", "Marketing: I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: S So maybe titanium it's not a good idea .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .  We need to think about  mm mm .", "Marketing: Seems not , seems not .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Um  sorry Mark .", "Marketing: So", "Project Manager: It seems to be", "Marketing: Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy ,", "Industrial Designer: Fruit . Even shape ?", "Marketing: as a  even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . I mean", "Industrial Designer: More", "Project Manager: Mm-mm .", "Industrial Designer: yeah . Yeah .", "Marketing: And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Project Manager: Hmm .  You're old-fashioned .", "Marketing: So that's what people seem to   yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought", "Project Manager: Sorry .", "Marketing: but that's that's fashion and", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: Okay that's all I have to say .", "Project Manager: Mm you have questions ?", "Industrial Designer: So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? Or it's", "Marketing: These  I'm sorry .", "Industrial Designer: This  you you  so did you", "Marketing: Yeah , yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course ,", "Industrial Designer: Where ? Oh . Oh , okay , mm-hmm .", "Marketing: as you know our company is quite big and uh so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends", "Industrial Designer: It's not from  mm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah .", "Marketing: that are also", "Industrial Designer: It's more general trend", "Marketing: well .", "Industrial Designer: it's not particular to the remote control .", "Marketing: No , it's not it's not  this this is very general , yeah . But it seems that trends travel across things .", "Industrial Designer: Mm . Yeah .", "Marketing: The  what we", "Industrial Designer: Yeah but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy", "Marketing: Sure .", "Industrial Designer: or", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: yeah yeah .", "Marketing: We have to  I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables", "Industrial Designer: yeah , yeah sponge , yeah yeah at least that's", "Marketing: but we still have to put our chips inside , so   of course .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah", "Marketing: This is your problem .", "Industrial Designer: that  yeah yeah .", "Marketing: This is not mine .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , looking  yeah fruit . These things can be easily incorporated . We can have t colours or this shape", "Marketing: Yeah , I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material .", "Industrial Designer: or at least", "Marketing: If if it's something like rubber made or  I think it it's also going to be good .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Okay ?", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: No more question ? Okay .", "Marketing: Yep . Thanks .", "Project Manager: So   Mm-hmm . Okay , so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again . Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design ,", "Industrial Designer: Look and feel de", "Project Manager: um Mark the user interface design , and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation .  Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm . Hmm . Mm sounds interesting .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm um and I   as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction .", "Marketing: Okay .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Marketing: Thanks .", "Industrial Designer: So , can we highlight the specific features of our", "Project Manager: Yeah you're right , you have to", "Industrial Designer: yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables ,", "Project Manager: So", "Industrial Designer: that's", "Project Manager: you say s", "Industrial Designer: we want to follow general trend .", "Marketing: Spongy .", "Project Manager: S", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: do we agree on that ? Yeah . We have to .", "Industrial Designer: So , do you think", "Marketing: No , we don't have to ,", "User Interface: So we have to uh for", "Project Manager: No .", "Marketing: but seems it's the trend .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm . Yeah .", "Marketing: Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend .", "User Interface: yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: So there's no  Well , that's  you t can try to convince us .", "User Interface: Well , we can make it smell like fruit .", "Marketing: Okay .   that's a good idea ,", "Project Manager: Okay ,  that's a good idea .", "Industrial Designer: That's", "Project Manager: So titanium smell like fruit .", "Marketing: I", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: So what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? Or they really like  They more want these fancy features", "Marketing: Uh  I think i", "Industrial Designer: like", "Marketing: yeah i it's again in this uh what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Feature  Yeah .", "Marketing: because we have it", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: and others don't .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: It's fancy . Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important .", "Project Manager: I I agree with uh this uh", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .", "Project Manager: Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Uh we will try to explore these two options", "Project Manager: Mm . Yeah , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: and", "Marketing: Maybe you could explore the two option .", "Industrial Designer: yeah yeah .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean  fruit-shaped .", "Industrial Designer: Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or", "Project Manager: Don't you say that you cannot do double shape  uh curved shape", "User Interface: But  Doub double-curved .", "Industrial Designer: yeah it's it's", "Marketing: Mm . Seems to be  .", "Project Manager: yeah .", "Industrial Designer: yeah that's a  we're to look for", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: and and s we're to see the  whether rubber is expensive", "User Interface: Okay , okay . In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the  like titanium panels on a whole rubber body .", "Industrial Designer: and d Hmm .", "Project Manager: Mm-mm . Okay , so", "User Interface: Well , okay w we'll see .", "Project Manager: you explore now that you're going to work together these these two .", "User Interface: Yeah", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Project Manager: Or or spongy an yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Maybe we can have two different  assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: we have only the plastic or the  the chippy  yeah fibre chips or", "User Interface: We'll see . We'll see .", "Marketing: If you have time .", "Project Manager: Mm . Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose . If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy", "Industrial Designer: Uh .", "Project Manager: but uh it cannot be both .", "User Interface: We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some  for for", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: For creation .", "User Interface: I dunno uh  yeah um", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: we'll look .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium .", "Industrial Designer: Even design .", "Marketing: You can paint it afterward  .", "User Interface: Okay , okay .", "Marketing: No problem . We have a very large department of  paint .", "Project Manager: Yeah , do don't worry , you you  you speak with  mm mm .", "Marketing: You will do it .", "User Interface: Alright , alright .", "Project Manager: Okay . So explore a shape .", "Industrial Designer: So still we want to keep LCD ? Or", "Project Manager: Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an LCD with uh information .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Not uh", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says  if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , then we can", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: yeah , yeah , that  user friendly", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: or", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Marketing: That's the converse to having zillions of button", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: where each button does only one thing .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah , yeah , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: yeah yeah j yeah ,", "Marketing: Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel .", "Industrial Designer: because   Yeah .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Marketing: Anyway it's very  in general I think people uh change TV more often than batteries of their remote control .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: So .  Because the trend goes faster than the life of the", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: So it's  very", "Project Manager: Okay .

And again I'll take minutes . The  what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: It does look very cool .", "Project Manager: Um then", "Project Manager: then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .", "Project Manager: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes .

How how much do we have , forty minutes ?", "Project Manager: Is that right ?", "User Interface: Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: until about four fifteen . So yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Okay , so .", "Project Manager: Go for it . Do you want", "User Interface: So , you said um  are are we starting with the the", "Project Manager: Yes .", "Industrial Designer: Presentation .", "User Interface: so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and", "Industrial Designer: Okay .  Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and   we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .", "Marketing: You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?", "Industrial Designer: Um", "Marketing: It's a bit um phallic .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Um", "User Interface: Well , but it's it's just an a approximation .", "Project Manager: Dual use , perfect .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Dual use , perfect .", "Marketing: Oh ,   your remote control ? Oh that's just bad .", "Project Manager: Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ?", "Industrial Designer: Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .", "Project Manager: Sorry , sorry .", "Industrial Designer: So now we we have the  okay ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Wow .", "Industrial Designer: and uh  the the LCD and and the scroll are inside . Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah .", "Project Manager: And it's  the whole thing's made of rubber , is that", "User Interface: Uh yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah .", "User Interface: Rubber .", "Marketing: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?", "User Interface: Yeah ,  . Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be  and", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ,", "User Interface: so we said the back side round , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: It l does look like the  curvy", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Mm . Hmm .", "User Interface: Yeah . And it's spongy as well .", "Marketing: I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah .", "User Interface: So  so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the  on the cover we just have the very basic things .", "Project Manager: Huh . Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three  there would be numbers in in the  on the actual one .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .", "Project Manager: Six seven eight nine . I like that .", "User Interface: Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and  like the previous one and the next one .", "Project Manager: Uh-huh .", "User Interface: And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .", "Marketing: So where's the volume ?", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: The volume is is scrolling .", "Industrial Designer: It's on the side .", "User Interface: On the side ,", "Marketing: Ah , you did get that in then ,", "User Interface: this one . Yeah you just do it like this .", "Marketing: mm-hmm .", "User Interface: And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .", "Marketing: Oh okay ,  .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: See ? So the volume is  you just scroll , but then once you flip it open ,  okay , there there you have the screen", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: and and you have the mm  spinning wheel with options to choose .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Cool . Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button .", "Industrial Designer: Uh no , we we'd not put", "User Interface: A mute button .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials .", "User Interface: Well ,  we'll have this on the screen , on the display .", "Project Manager: Y or you could have it  so you  on the wheel if you", "Marketing: On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .", "Industrial Designer: Uh on the LCD we r you know , the main menu will have various options .", "User Interface: Well , but the but the mute  yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?", "Project Manager: But if you hold it in ,", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Marketing: Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ?", "Project Manager: if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ?", "Marketing: Okay , cool .", "User Interface: Okay , yeah , okay .", "Marketing: So that  that solves the whole mute issue .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "User Interface: Yeah .

And we do have the logo on it as well .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm , very good .", "User Interface: So I think it", "Project Manager: And it's   with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: .", "Industrial Designer: Cool .", "User Interface: Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: We ran out of resources here , so .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: In the actual one .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: You can have a look .", "User Interface: So if you have questions .", "Project Manager: Very good , let's have a look .", "Project Manager: Test it out .", "Marketing: .", "Project Manager: Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess .", "Marketing: Yeah , oh , we hold the remote .", "Marketing: Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy .", "Marketing: I hate Play-Do , it's just minging .", "Marketing: But yeah , uh that's cool , cool .", "Project Manager: Very good .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: and then we'll there", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , see the budget .", "Project Manager: I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow .", "Project Manager: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country", "Project Manager: and cut some of the prices that way .", "Marketing: Wales .", "Project Manager: Wales , for example .", "Marketing: Mm . Cool , okay . Right , okay .   Fabulous ,", "Project Manager: Marketing Expert .", "Marketing: yeah . Okay , cool . So what we're gonna do is prefer  prepare the evaluation of the new design .  Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Um , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like  so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: Okay ?", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Cool , so these are what they are . Oh", "Project Manager: So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . Is that right ?", "Marketing: Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points .", "Project Manager: Mm dots , never mind .", "Marketing: Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good .", "Industrial Designer: I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything .", "User Interface: Yeah , the yeah , it's definitely attractive .", "Project Manager: Yeah , I agree .", "User Interface: Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot .", "Marketing: Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the TV ?", "Project Manager: Yeah , just prepare one now .", "User Interface: Yeah . Shall I just prepare it now ?", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: It will be red , too .", "Marketing: Cool . Okay . So , be attractive to look at . That's this one . What do you all say ?", "Industrial Designer: So ?", "Project Manager: I reckon it", "User Interface: S seven was th the maximum , yeah ?", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: I I go for seven .", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "Marketing: Oh  we're all so proud of the  .", "Project Manager: Seven , yeah , it's terribly sexy . Yeah .", "Marketing: Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ .", "Marketing: Could  oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in .", "Project Manager: Ah , okay .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: Excellent .

Yeah .  Okay . So , costs are within budget ,", "Marketing: Yes .", "User Interface: Yes .", "Project Manager: well within budget , including a little  what have we got ?

Then we don't have to worry about it .", "User Interface: Ready for this ?", "Project Manager: All set ? Cool . Alright , it is PowerPoint time . I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment", "Industrial Designer: Yeah  .", "Project Manager: which is kind of fun .", "User Interface: Oh man .", "Project Manager: So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um   right so um , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my  that my coach was sending to me . It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .", "Industrial Designer: Oh really ?", "Project Manager: I think .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: Huh .", "Project Manager: I don't know . Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary", "Project Manager: and I'm  therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go um  just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , uh , I will open them slowly , no ? Wait for it , wait for it .", "Marketing: Yeah that's not you .", "Project Manager: No . That's how the", "Project Manager: Wait .", "Project Manager: This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh  last meeting was that  um we that we had meetings from  uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um  uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some  mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at .  So . That's sorted , back to the main  meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys .", "Industrial Designer: Well . Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . What's to be said about it ? Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . This is going to be the on off button", "Industrial Designer: and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out ,", "Marketing: Ah .", "Project Manager: Nice .", "Industrial Designer: why not ?", "Marketing: Fair enough .", "Industrial Designer: Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um .", "Project Manager: Perfect .", "Industrial Designer: Go ahead .", "User Interface: No it's important to  we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here", "Marketing: Mm .", "User Interface: um f we call it fruity", "Marketing: Right .", "User Interface: if you will . Um . Right , um ,", "Marketing: Appropriate , okay .", "User Interface: of course that's uh interchangeable", "User Interface: and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued", "Marketing: Mm 'kay .", "User Interface: but this is kind of something that can be done", "Marketing: It is an option .", "User Interface: um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there .", "Project Manager: Oh , right .", "Industrial Designer: That's this here .", "Marketing: Ah . I see .", "User Interface: Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel ,", "User Interface: um , so I think that will work well with regards to our market . Um and uh let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available .  Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ?", "Industrial Designer: Um I worried about the materials , it is uh  the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel .", "User Interface: It's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside .", "Industrial Designer: Fact , I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen ,", "Project Manager: Oh well done yeah , yeah oh ok", "Industrial Designer: I thought that was kinda nice .", "Marketing: Nice .", "Industrial Designer: This was actually an apple on the inside .", "Industrial Designer: This", "Marketing: Do we need to worry about um rot factors ?", "User Interface: Um  it's encased in a new uh type of uh", "Marketing: Oh okay , there's preservatives involved ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "User Interface: polymer yeah .", "Marketing: we don't need to worry ,", "Industrial Designer: We got a bit ahead of ourselves ,", "User Interface: It's fine .", "Marketing: okay .", "Industrial Designer: I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but", "User Interface: Hmm .", "Marketing: Fair enough .", "Project Manager: Edible televisions , it's a wave of the future .", "Marketing: No but", "User Interface: It's pos a possible new product .", "Marketing: It's a couple years off at least . Okay .", "User Interface: Um , but I think that's  I think that sums up the main features of our  of the remote ,", "Project Manager: Brilliant .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "User Interface: um I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh  whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature . Um , did we come in under budget ?", "Industrial Designer: Uh we did , yeah . This cost  well to put this into um production , we're looking at about  what was our goal ? It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine .", "Industrial Designer: Um , so I was quite pleased with that .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: One thing that we didn't do um  obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that", "Marketing: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down .", "Project Manager: Brilliant .", "Industrial Designer: So even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition ,", "Marketing: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper .", "Marketing: Okay .", "User Interface: Mm .  Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ?", "Industrial Designer: And  Oh no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ?", "User Interface: So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console", "Marketing: Okay .", "User Interface: and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: Um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with . Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier", "Marketing: Mm 'kay .", "User Interface: and um , I think that uh has given a proven um  ease of use and what not .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm . Yeah .", "User Interface: And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so .", "Marketing: Right .", "Project Manager: Cool .", "Industrial Designer: Any questions ?", "Project Manager: No , no", "Marketing: Do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ?", "Project Manager: I think that's", "Marketing: In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ?", "Industrial Designer: Um , do you wanna answer this one", "Marketing: Do we know where we stand on that yet ?", "Industrial Designer: or do you want me to answer it ?", "User Interface: Well we didn't quite have enough material uh  .", "Marketing: Oh I wasn't expecting a prototype", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah .", "User Interface: Oh I see ,", "Marketing: I just didn't know  if you guys had any in mind yet .", "User Interface: right , um .", "Industrial Designer: Um , well  as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like", "Marketing: Okay . Just veneer really ,", "User Interface: Right .", "Marketing: yeah . Okay .", "User Interface: Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that .", "Marketing: And the whole thing", "Marketing: Okay", "User Interface: So I mean there are  I", "Marketing: Right", "User Interface: we definitely priced out a spongy  even spongier non-natural look um materials", "Marketing: Yeah . There's  Okay .", "User Interface: which I think worked out fine . We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green .", "Marketing: Mm 'kay . Okay , very cool .", "Industrial Designer: It's not it's not quite a a face plate , it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough", "Marketing: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: that in the factory it could  we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way", "Marketing: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: if you know what I mean .", "Marketing: Yep . It's still an option if we need it .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Very cool , nice job .", "Project Manager: Right , yeah thanks guys that's very , very good work . I like it , brilliant .  Um ,  what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um I got me  you've got  you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance . Um , it's a spreadsheet of the parts", "Industrial Designer: Oh .", "Project Manager: and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um .", "Industrial Designer: Ooh .", "Project Manager: I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , but it looks like  So we'll just  if we can just itemize what's in here , we've got this  it's a solar cell thing right ?", "Industrial Designer: Right", "Project Manager: With a back-up battery ?", "Industrial Designer: uh we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there ,", "Project Manager: With the ba okay . Um", "Industrial Designer: yep .", "Project Manager: and", "User Interface: The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . Yeah .", "Project Manager: Clever , clever , well done . Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um   It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah . It's just making use of the same space and the same materials ,", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Okay . Um and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that  be the general", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , one big curve I guess you could say .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . Um . Push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Um . And um a special  I guess it's uh  we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that  throughout ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , special .", "Project Manager: yeah .", "Industrial Designer: And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , don't you ? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional ,", "Project Manager: Yeah , it's it's quite unique .", "Industrial Designer: I like to think of it as unconventional .", "Project Manager: I like it , yeah it's  So it looks like", "Marketing: M come in at sixteen ?", "Project Manager: a bit over budget , um .", "Industrial Designer: Oh . Huh , doesn't match up does it ?", "Project Manager: So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells  um or take out the back-up battery . Uh", "Industrial Designer: How do you feel about that ?", "User Interface: I mean I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that  you know what the sell is on that .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: what am I gonna do ?", "Marketing: Mm k .", "Industrial Designer: People'd be real upset . I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery ,", "Marketing: True .", "Industrial Designer: it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have .", "Project Manager: Hmm .  What's difficult , we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now ,", "Marketing: Nah .", "Project Manager: it would have to be  seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way . Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , um", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental  I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly .", "Industrial Designer: Hmm .", "User Interface: I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that  we  our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing", "Marketing: I mean", "User Interface: I mean that's what sets us apart", "Marketing: Which , it's", "User Interface: right ?", "Marketing: yeah that's what setting us into this young market , I mean that's where we started from , so   I don't know , and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "User Interface: And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here", "Marketing: Right . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "User Interface: and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here", "Project Manager: It's either or .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . I guess we might have to do that .", "Marketing: I think unfortunately that's our best option .", "Industrial Designer: It's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal isn't it ? Of twelve fifty .", "Marketing: Mm .", "Project Manager: 'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ,  .", "Marketing: It  kind of", "Project Manager: um and we can't get rid of the uh  I mean removing the", "User Interface: Savings .", "Marketing: yeah .", "Project Manager: changing the case wouldn't be so much of a  mm-mm , um , nor would changing the case materials .", "Marketing: Mm-mm .", "Project Manager: Um . So yeah that looks like to be the only thing . So that would be the", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: it's a major change but  Yeah . Alright , so", "Industrial Designer: Gotta do what you gotta do .", "Project Manager: we're in agreement on that .", "Marketing: Unfortunately I think we are .", "User Interface: No , I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah .", "Project Manager: Right . Moving along swiftly . Um , so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over .", "Marketing: That would be me . Um cord ?", "Project Manager: Ah of course , sorry .", "Marketing: No problem .", "Project Manager: Whoosh .", "Marketing: Can you reach ,", "User Interface: Yep .", "Marketing: that would be great , thank you .", "Project Manager: That'd be great", "Marketing: I didn't even do that one on purpose either ,", "Marketing: damn . Okay , um , basically I was just evaluating um  from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of  these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important . Um so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? Is the design what we wanted it to do ? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? Um . Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? Does it respond to voice recognition ? And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Marketing: Um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface , um that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense .", "Industrial Designer: Really good .", "Marketing: So I think overall we're headed in the right direction .  So .", "User Interface: They like that spongy feel .", "Marketing: Yeah . It looks like it's going over well , so", "User Interface: And the paging function works well ,", "Industrial Designer: Six ?", "User Interface: that's good to hear ,", "Marketing: we're we're good yeah .", "User Interface: we worked hard on that one .", "Project Manager: Brilliant .", "Industrial Designer: We did .", "Marketing: Yeah . It's  I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , so it's all good .", "Industrial Designer: I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel", "Marketing: That's everything from me .", "Project Manager: Hmm .", "Industrial Designer: but it's okay .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Marketing: Yeah , it is a set-back , but", "Marketing: Okay , do you need the cord back ?", "Project Manager: Um yeah ,", "User Interface: W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again", "Project Manager: I was just  go on .", "Industrial Designer: I know .", "User Interface: that we're", "Project Manager: Well they don't own tellys anyway do they ?", "Industrial Designer: True .", "User Interface: I guess that's true .", "Project Manager: Right . So , um ,  this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . I got this slide from the coach and I'm not sure what it's connected to . Um so I guess we are going to discuss um  our project process um", "Project Manager: and that is gonna go into my report . So I guess this is the point where we go um  uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess , um .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: As in within the team or ?", "Project Manager: I think so yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: I think it's  I mm-hmm , I think so .

So you would just read that one . And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines . And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . And I 'll give  I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes . Um . Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about  stuff before everyone 's here .", "Professor C: Mmm . Well , we have one more coming .", "Grad A: OK .

So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth , and then , at the corner . And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds , so that when you 're breathing , you don't breathe into the mike . Um . Yeah , that 's good . And uh  So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form . And the short form  I mean , you should read the consent form , but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . So , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you don't like .

So this is  The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future . This is a mock - up of one . Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood . Um .  The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , and record it , and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting . So that 's my particular interest , is a portable device to do m uh , information retrieval on meetings . Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings . Um . So the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data . And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones , and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes , as well as the close talking mikes . What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth , gives us , um , high quality audio , um , especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus . So , for people who are more interested in language , we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available . And then also , um , it 's a very , very hard task in terms of speech recognition . Um . And so , uh , on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results . So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two . So that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time . And then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like , um , beam - forming on all the microphones and do research like that . Our intention is to release this data to the public , um , probably through f through a body like the LDC . And , uh , just make it as a generally available corpus . Um .  There 's other work going on in meeting recording . So , we 're  we 're working with SRI , with UW , Um . NIST has started an effort which will include video . We 're not including video , obviously . And uh  and then also , um , a small amount of assistance from IBM . Is also involved . Um . Oh , and the digit strings , this is just a more constrained task . Um . So because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to  to do at least one set of digit strings to give ourselves something easier . And it 's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits , which is a common connected digits corpus . So we 'll have some , um , comparison to be able to be made .", "Professor C: OK .", "Grad A: Anything else ?", "Professor C: No .", "Grad A: OK , so when the l last person comes in , just have them wear a wireless .

And uh , just give me a call , which , my number 's up there when your meeting is over .", "Professor C: Yep .", "Grad A: And  I 'm going to leave the mike here but it 's n  Uh , but I 'm not gonna be on so don't have them use this one .

Wow ! Organization . So you guys who got email about this  oh f uh , Friday or something about what we 're up to .", "Grad E: No .", "Grad F: No .", "Grad B: I got it .", "Grad E: What was the nature of the email ?", "Professor C: Oh , this was about  um , inferring intentions from features in context , and the words , like \" s go to see \" , or \" visit \" , or some", "Grad B: Wel - we I  uh  I  I", "Professor C: You didn't get it ?", "Grad E: I don't think I did .", "Professor C: I guess these g have got better filters . Cuz I sent it to everybody . You just blew it off .", "Grad E: Ah .", "Professor C: OK .", "Grad B: It 's really simple though . So this is the idea . Um . We could pursue , um , if we thought it 's  it 's worth it but , uh , I think we  we will agree on that , um , to come up with a  with a sort of very , very first crude prototype , and do some implementation work , and do some  some research , and some modeling . So the idea is if you want to go somewhere , um , and focus on that object down  Oh , I can actually walk with this . This is nice . down here . That 's the Powder - Tower . Now , um ,  we found in our , uh , data and from experiments , that there 's three things you can do . Um , you can walk this way , and come really , really close to it . And touch it . But you cannot enter or do anything else . Unless you 're interested in rock climbing , it won't do you no good standing there . It 's just a dark alley . But you can touch it . If you want to actually go up or into the tower , you have to go this way , and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth . If you actually want to see the tower , and that 's what actually most people want to do , is just have a good look of it , take a picture for the family ,  you have to go this way , and go up here . And there you have a vre really view  It exploded , the  during the Thirty years - war . Really uh , interesting sight . And um , these uh  these lines are , um , paths ,", "Grad E: Mmm .", "Grad B: or so That 's ab er , i the street network of our geographic information system . And you can tell that we deliberately cut out this part . Because otherwise we couldn't get our GIS system to take  to lead people this way . It would always use the closest point to the object , and then the tourists would be faced , you know , in front of a wall , but it would do them absolutely no good . So ,  what we found interesting is , first of all , intentions differ . Maybe you want to enter a building . Maybe you want to see it , take a picture of it . Or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building . For whatever reason that may be .", "Grad E: What 's it  what 's it made out of ?", "Grad B: Um , r red limestone .", "Grad E: So maybe you would wanna touch it .", "Grad B: Yeah , maybe you would want to touch it . Um . Okay , I  This , um  These intentions , we  w w we could , if we want to , call it the  the Vista mode , where we just want to  eh  s get the overview or look at it , the Enter mode , and the , well , Tango mode . I always come up with  with silly names . So this \" Tango \" means , literally translated , \" to touch \" . So  But sometimes the  the Tango mode is really relevant in the  in the sense that , um , if you want to , uh  If you don't have the intention of entering your building , but you know that something is really close to it , and you just want to approach it , or get to that building . Consider , for example , the Post Office in Chicago , a building so large that it has its own zip code . So the entrance could be miles away from the closest point . So sometimes it m m m makes sense maybe to d to distinguish there . So , um , I 've looked , uh , through twenty some  Uh , I didn't look through all the data . um , and there  there 's uh , a lot more different ways in people  uh , the ways people phrase how to g get  if they want to get to a certain place . And sometimes here it 's b it 's a little bit more obvious  Um .  Maybe I should go back a couple of steps and go through the", "Professor C: No , OK come in , sit down .

OK . Afterwards is fine .", "Grad B: They are uncomfortable . Mm - hmm .", "Grad D: Really small ? OK . I see . OK .", "Grad B: Yep .", "Grad D: Thank you .", "Grad B: OK , but that was our idea .", "Professor C: And it  it  it  it it also has to be switched on , Nance .", "Grad B: Is  I  I think", "Grad E: No , that one 's already on , I thought he said .", "Professor C: It 's on ? OK , good .", "Grad D: OK . It 's on .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Grad B: OK . That was the idea . Um , people , when they w when they want to go to a building , sometimes they just want to look at it . Sometimes they want to enter it . And sometimes they want to get really close to it . That 's something we found . It 's just a truism . And the places where you will lead them for these intentions are sometimes ex in incredibly different . I  I gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where  if you want to enter it . So , this is sort of how people may , uh  may phrase those requests to a  a  a mock - up system at least that 's the way they did it . And we get tons of  of these \" how do I get to \" , \" I want to go to \" , but also , \" give me directions to \" , and \" I would like to see \" . And um , what we can sort of do , if we look closer a closer at the  the data  That was the wrong one . um , we can look at some factors that may make a difference . First of all , very important , and um , that  I 've completely forgot that when we talked . This is of course a crucial factor , \" what type of object is it ? \" So , some buildings you just don't want to take pictures of . Or very rarely . But you usually want to enter them . Some objects are more picturesque , and you  more f more highly photographed . Then of course the  the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants . Um . Sometimes I found in the  Uh , looking at the data , in a superficial way , I found some s sort of modifiers that  that m may also give us a hint , um , \" I 'm trying to get to \" Nuh ? \" I need to get to \" . Sort of hints to the fact that you 're not really sightseeing and  and just f there for pleasure and so forth and so on . And this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered . That whatever it is you 're doing at the moment may also inter influence the interpretation of  of a phrase . So , this is , uh , really uh , uh , uh  My suggestion is really simple . We start with , um  Now , Let me , uh , say one more thing . What we do know , is that the parser we use in the SmartKom system will never differentiate between any of these . So , basically all of these things will result in the same XML M - three - L structure . Sort of action \" go \" , and then an object .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad B: Yeah ? and a source . So it 's  it 's  it 's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions . So , I thought , \" Mmm ! Maybe for a deep understanding task , that 's a nice sort of playground or first little thing . \" Where we can start it and n sort of look  \" OK , we need , we gonna get those M - three - L structures . The crude , undifferentiated parse . Interpreted input . We may need additional part of speech , or maybe just some information on the verb , and modifiers , auxiliaries . We 'll see . And I will try to  to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there , and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context . So this is not something which we can actually monitor ,  now , but just is something we can set . And then you can all imagine sort of a  a constrained satisfaction program , depending on  on what , um , comes out . We want to have an  a structure resulting if we feed it through a belief - net or  or something along those lines . We 'd get an inferred intention , we  we produce a structure that differentiates between the Vista , the Enter , and the , um , Tango mode . Which I think we maybe want to ignore . But . That 's my idea . It 's up for discussion . We can change all of it , any bit of it . Throw it all away .", "Grad F: Now @ @ this email that you sent , actually .", "Professor C: What ?", "Grad F: Now I remember the email .", "Professor C: OK .", "Grad E: Huh . Still , I have no recollection whatsoever of the email . I 'll have to go back and check .", "Professor C: Not important . So , what is important is that we understand what the proposed task is . And , the  the i uh , Robert and I talked about this some on Friday . And we think it 's well - formed . So we think it 's a well - formed , uh , starter task for this , uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain .", "Grad F: So , where exactly is the , uh , deeper understanding being done ? Like I mean , s is it before the Bayes - net ? Is it , uh", "Professor C: Well , it 's the  it 's  it 's always all of it . So , in general it 's always going to be , the answer is , everywhere . Uh , so the notion is that , uh , this isn't real deep . But it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of , uh , going to see some tourist thing . And , so that 's  that 's the quote \" deep \" that we 're trying to get at . And , Robert 's point is that the current front - end doesn't give you any way to  Not only doesn't it do it , but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it . It isn't like , if you just took what the front - end gives you , and used some clever inference algorithm on it , you would be able to figure out which of these is going on . So , uh , and this is  Bu - I in general it 's gonna be true of any kind of deep understanding , there 's gonna be contextual things , there 're gonna be linguistic things , there 're gonna be discourse things , and they gotta be combined . And , my idea on how to combine them is with a belief - net , although it may turn out that t some totally different thing is gonna work better . Um , the idea would be that  you , uh , take your  You 're editing your slide ?", "Grad B: Yeah . As i a sort of , as I get ideas , uh w uh .", "Professor C: Oh .", "Grad B: So , discourse  I  I  I thought about that . Of course that needs to sort of go in there .", "Professor C: Oh . I 'm sorry . OK . So . This is minutes  taking minutes as we go , in his  in his own way .", "Grad B: Yep .", "Professor C: Um , but the p the  Anyway . So the thing is ,  i uh , d naively speaking , you 've  you 've got a  for this little task , a belief - net , which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things , that the person wants to  uh , to View it , to Enter it , or to Tango with it . Um . So that  the  the output of the belief - net is pretty well formed . And , then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things . And , then the question is  there are two questions  is , uh , one , where do you get this i  information from , and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ? So what are the conditional probabilities of this , that , and the other , given these things ? And you probably need intermediate nodes . I  we don't know what they are yet . So it may well be that , uh , for example , that , uh , knowing whether  Oh , another thing you want is some information abou I think , about the time of day . Now , they may wanna call that part of context .", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "Professor C: But the time of day matters a lot . And , if things are obviously closed , then , you", "Grad B: People won't want to enter it .", "Professor C: Pe - people don't wanna enter them . And , if it 's not obvious , you may want to actually uh , point out to people that it 's closed  you know , what they 're g going to is closed and they don't have the option of entering it .", "Grad B: s b", "Professor C: So another thing that can come up , and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is , that another option of course is to have a  more of a dialogue . So if someone says something you could ask them .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Professor C: OK . And  Now , one thing you could do is always ask them , but that 's boring . And it also w it also be a pain for the person using it . So one thing you could do is build a little system that , said , \" whenever you got a question like that I 've got one of three answers . Ask them which one you want . \" OK . But that 's , um , not what we 're gonna do .", "Grad B: But maybe that 's a false state of the system , that it 's too close to call .", "Professor C: Oh yeah . You want the  you want the ability to a You want the ability to ask , but what you don't wanna do is onl build a system that always asks every time , and i That 's not getting at the scientific problem ,", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "Professor C: and it 's  In general you 're  you know , it 's gonna be much more complex than that . a This is purposely a really simple case .", "Grad B: Yeah .", "Professor C: So , uh  Yeah .", "Grad B: I have one more point to  to Bhaskara 's question . Um , I think also the  the  the deep understanding part of it is  is going to be in there to the extent that we um , want it in terms of our modeling . We can start , you know , basic from human beings , model that , its motions , going , walking , seeing , we can mem model all of that and then compose whatever inferences o we make out of these really conceptual primitives . That will be extremely deep in the  in  in  in my understanding .", "Professor C: Yeah . S so  so the way that might come up , if you wanna  Suppose you wanted to do that , you might say , \" Um , as an intermediate step in your belief - net , is there a Source - Path - Goal schema involved ? \" OK ?

First you have to know  find out how to get to that place , maybe with the intention of buying stamps in there . Maybe  So , the next task is to get to a certain place and take a picture for your grandchild . The third one is to get information on the history of an object . The fourth one  And then the g system breaks down . It crashes , And", "Grad D: a At the third ? Right then ?", "Grad B: After the third task .", "Grad D: OK .", "Grad B: And then  Or after the fourth . Some find  @ @  Forget that for now . And then , a human operator comes on , and  and exp apologizes that the system has crashed , but , you know , urges you to continue , you know ? now with a human operator . And so , you have basically the same tasks again , just with different objects , and you go through it again , and that was it . Oh , and one  one little bit  w And uh , the computer you are  you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are , via GPS . When the human operator comes on , um , that person does not know . So the GPS is crashed as well . So the person first has to ask you \" Where are you ? \" . And so you have to do some  s tell the person sort of where you are , depending on what you see there . Um , this is a  a  a  a  a bit that I d I don't think we  Did we discuss that bit ? Uh , I just sort of squeezed that in now . But it 's something , uh , that would provide some very interesting data for some people I know . So .", "Grad D: So , in the display you can  Oh , you said that you cou you might have a display that shows , like , the", "Grad B: Yeah . a Additionally , y you have a  a  a sort of a map type display .", "Grad D: a w your perspective ? sort of ?", "Grad B: Uh , two - D .", "Grad D: And so , as you", "Grad B: n", "Grad D: Oh , two - D . OK .", "Grad B: Two - D .", "Grad D: So as you move through it that 's - they just track it on the  for themselves", "Grad B: Yeah . b y You don't  That 's", "Grad D: there .", "Grad B: I don't know . I but y I don't think you really move , sort of .", "Grad D: OK . So", "Grad B: Yeah ? I mean that would be an  an  an enormous technical effort , unless we would  We can show it walks to , you know . We can have movies of walking , you walking through  through Heidelberg , and u ultimately arriving there .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad B: Maybe we wanna do that . Yeah .", "Grad D: Uh , I was just trying to figure out how  how ambitious the system is .", "Grad B: The map was sort of intended to  You want to go to that place . You know , and it 's sort of there .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad B: And you see the label of the name  So we get those names , pronunciation stuff , and so forth , and we can change that .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . So your tasks don't require you to  I mean , uh  yo you 're told  So when your task is , I don't know , \" Go buy stamps \" or something like that ? So , do you have to respond ? or does your  Uh , what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system ? Like , w what you 're doing now ? or", "Grad B: Well , we 'll see what people do .", "Grad D: There 's no  OK , so it 's just like , \" Let 's figure out what they would say under the circumstances \" .", "Grad B: Yeah , and  and we will record both sides . I mean , we will record the Wi - the Wizard", "Grad D: Uh - huh .", "Grad B: I mean , in both cases it 's gonna be a human , in the computer , and in the operator case .", "Grad D: Uh - huh .", "Grad B: And we will re there will be some dialogue , you know ? So , you first have to do this , and that ,", "Grad D: Yep .", "Grad B: and  and", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Grad B: see wh what they say . We can ins instruct the , uh , wizard in how expressive and talkative he should be . But um , maybe the  maybe what you 're suggesting  Is what you 're suggesting that it might be too poor , the data , if we sort of limit it to this ping pong one t uh , task results in a question and then there 's an answer and that 's the end of the task ? You wanna m have it more  more steps , sort of ?", "Grad D: Yeah , I  I don't know how much direction is given to the subject about what their interaction  I mean , th they 're unfamiliar w with interacting with the system .", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "Grad D: All they know is it 's this great system that could do s stuff .", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "Professor C: Oh yeah , but  to some extent this is a different discussion .", "Grad D: Right ? So", "Professor C: OK ? So . Uh , we  we have to have this discussion of th the experiment , and the data collection , and all that sorta stuff", "Grad D: Uh - huh .", "Professor C: and we do have , um , a student who is a candidate for wizard . Uh , she 's gonna get in touch with me . It 's a student of Eve 's . FEY , Fey ? Spelled FEY . Do you  do you", "Grad D: Oh , Fey Parrill .", "Professor C: You know her ?", "Grad D: Yeah .

So we may have someone , uh , to do this , and she 's got you know , some background in  in all this stuff . And is a linguist st and , so So .  That 's  So , Nancy , we 'll have an At some point we 'll have another discussion on exactly wha t t you know , how that 's gonna go .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Professor C: And um , Jane , but also , uh , Liz have offered to help us do this , uh , data collection and design and stuff .", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .

I guess the reason I was asking about the sort of the de the details of this kind of thing is that , um , it 's one thing to collect data for , I don't know , speech recognition or various other tasks that have pretty c clear correct answers , but with intention  um , obviously , as you point out , there 's a lot of di other factors and  I 'm not really sure , um , how  how  e the question of how to make it a t appropriate toy version of that  Um , it 's ju it 's just hard . So , I mean , obviously it 's a", "Grad E: Yeah , uh , actually I guess that was my question . Is the intention implicit in the scenario that 's given ?

Right .", "Grad E: OK .", "Professor C: So , we that 's part of what we 'll have to figure out .", "Grad D: Right .", "Professor C: But , uh ,", "Grad D: Mm - hmm .", "Professor C: the  The problem that I was tr gonna try to focus on today was , let 's suppose by magic you could collect dialogues in which , one way or the other , you were able to , uh , figure out both the intention , and set the context , and know what language was used . So let 's suppose that we can get that kind of data . Um . The issue is , can we find a way to , basically , featurize it so that we get some discrete number of features so that , uh , when we know the values to all those features , or as many as possible , we can w come up with the best estimate of which of the , in this case three little intentions , are most likely .", "Grad D: w What are the t three intentions ? Is it to go there , to see it , and", "Grad B: To come as close as possible to it .", "Professor C: Th - the terminology we 're using is to", "Grad D: Yeah , it 's @ @ .", "Professor C: Go back .

I didn't get that before .", "Grad E: See , I would have thought it was more of a waltz .", "Grad B: S To \" Waltz \" it ?", "Grad D: Yeah , like , how close are you gonna be ?", "Professor C: Well .", "Grad D: Like ,  Tango 's really close .", "Grad E: Yeah , cuz a tango  Yeah .", "Professor C: Well , anyway . So", "Grad F: All these So , like , the question is how what features can  like , do you wanna try to extract from , say , the parse or whatever ?", "Professor C: Right .", "Grad F: Like , the presence of a word or the presence of a certain uh , stem , or  certain construction or whatever .", "Professor C: Right . Is there a construction , or the kind of object , or w uh , anything else that 's in the si It 's either in the  in the s the discourse itself or in the context . So if it turns out that , whatever it is , you want to know whether the person 's uh , a tourist or not , OK ? that becomes a feature . Now , how you determine that is another issue . But fo for the current problem , it would just be , \" OK , if you can be sure that it 's a tourist , versus a businessman , versus a native , \" or something , uh , that would give you a lot of discriminatory power and then just have a little section in your belief - net that said , \" pppt ! \" Though sin f in the short run , you 'd set them ,", "Grad F: Mm - hmm .", "Professor C: and see ho how it worked , and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . From previous discourse or w any anything else you knew .", "Grad F: Right . So , how should  What 's the uh , plan ? Like , how should we go about figuring out these", "Professor C: OK . So , first of all is , uh , do e either of you guys , you got a favorite belief - net that you 've , you know , played with ? JavaBayes or something ?", "Grad F: Oh . No , not really .", "Professor C: OK . Well , anyway . f Get one . OK ? So  y so one of th one of the things we wanna do is actually , uh , pick a package , doesn't matter which one , uh , presumably one that 's got good interactive abilities , cuz a lot of what we 're gonna be d You know , we don't need the one that 'll solve massive , uh , belief - nets quickly . d w These are not gonna get big in  in the foreseeable future . But we do want one in which it 's easy to interact with and , uh , modify . Because i that 's  A lot of what it 's gonna be , is , um , playing with this . And probably one in which it 's easy to have , um , what amounts to transcript files . So that if  if we have all these cases  OK ? So we make up cases that have these features , OK , and then you 'd like to be able to say , \" OK , here 's a bunch of cases \"  There 're even ones tha that you can do learning OK ? So you have all their cases and  and their results and you have a  algorithms to go through and run around trying to set the  the probabilities for you . Um , probably that 's not worth it . I mean , my guess is we aren't gonna have enough data that 's good enough to make the  these data fitting ones worth it , but I don't know . So I would say you guy the first task for you two guys is to um , pick a package . OK , and you wanna it s You know , the standard things you want it stable , you want it  yeah , @ @ . And , as soon as we have one , we can start trying to , uh , make a first cut at what 's going on .", "Grad B: An - Nuh .", "Professor C: But it  what I like about it is it 's very concrete . OK ? We  we have a  we know what the outcomes are gonna be , and we have some  some data that 's loose , we can use our own intuition , and see how hard it is , and , importantly , what intermediate nodes we think we need . So it  if it turns out that just , thinking about the problem , you come up with things you really need to  You know , this is the kind of thing that is , you know , an intermediate little piece in your belief - net . That 'd be really interesting .", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Grad B: And it  and it may serve as a platform for a person , maybe me , or whoever , who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis . I mean , w we have the For - FrameNet group here , and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already , that are contained in the data , um , you know , to come up with a nice little set of features and um , maybe even means of s uh , extracting them . And  and that altogether could also be  uh , become a nice paper that 's going to be published somewhere , if we sit down and write it . And um  When you said JavaBayes belief - net you were talking about ones that run on coffee ? or that are in the program language Java ?", "Professor C: No , th It turns out that there is a , uh  The new end of Java libraries . OK , and it turns out one called", "Grad B: Mmm . OK .", "Professor C: Which is one that fair  people around here use a fair amount . I have no idea whether that 's   The obvious advantage of that is that you can then , relatively easily , get all the other Java packages for GUIs or whatever else you might want to do .", "Grad B: Mm - hmm .", "Professor C: So that i that 's I think why a lot of people doing research use that . But it may not be  I have no idea whether that 's the best choice an and there 're plenty of people around , students in the department who , you know , live and breathe Bayes - nets . So , uh ,", "Grad D: There 's the m tool kit that um , Kevin Murphy has developed ,", "Professor C: Right . It 's OK .", "Grad D: which might be useful too .", "Grad F: Right .", "Professor C: So , yeah , Kevin would be a good person to start with .", "Grad D: And it 's available Matlab code .", "Professor C: Nancy knows him well .

M - three - L of course is XML . And the ontology that um , uh the student is  is constructing for me back in  in EML is in OIL and that 's also in XML . And so that 's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries , about hotels , about castles and stuff is gonna come from .", "Professor C: Mm - hmm . Yeah .", "Grad B: Um , so , if it has that IO capability and if it 's a Java package , it will definitely be able  We can couple .", "Professor C: Yeah . So , yeah , we 're sort of  committed to XML as the kind of , uh , interchange . But that 's , you know , not a big deal .", "Grad B: Who isn't , nuh ?", "Professor C: So , in terms of  of  interchanging in and out of any module we build , It 'll be XML . And if you 're going off to queries to the ontology , for example , you 'll have to deal with its interface . But that 's  that 's fine an and um , all of these things have been built with much bigger projects than this in mind . So they  they have worked very hard . It 's kind of blackboards and multi - wave blackboards and ways of interchanging and registering your a And so forth . So , that I don't think is even worth us worrying about just yet .

I 've downloaded them both , and I started to unpack the Linux one  Uh , the NT one worked fine . and I started unta pack the Linux one , it told me that I can't really unpack it because it contains a future date . So this is the time difference between Germany . I had to wait until one o ' clock this afternoon before I was able to unpack it . Now , um  Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine . And so that we have it .

Yeah . So the answer , Johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate .

We've received apologies for absence from Julie Morgan, and I'm very pleased to welcome David Rees, who is substituting for her today. Can I ask Members whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Thank you very much. Item 2 this morning, then, is a session with the Minister for Children and Social Care on the Welsh Government's childcare offer. So, I'm very pleased to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, Minister for Children and Social Care, also Jo-Anne Daniels, director for communities and tackling poverty, and Owain Lloyd, deputy director for childcare, play and early years. So, thank you, all, for your attendance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions come from Hefin David.", "Hefin David AM: Good morning, Minister. How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas, and is it something of a mixed bag?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: It's gone well, but I'm glad we've done it through this process of early implementer, actually piloting it, because we're learning lessons as we go along. It has gone well. It's been encouraging, to the extent that we're at the point where we're expanding\u2014we've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons. But, in terms of what we're learning, one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we're taking, because it's being done on the\u00a0seven early implementers. So, we're asking parents to come in, provide their wage slips, provide the birth certificates, and so on. You're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds, so it's difficult. And the burden of administration on that is falling to each pilot area. In one case, it's a whole authority, but it's only one\u2014that's in Blaenau Gwent. In others, it's smaller areas. So, we're also hitting those\u2014. The other big challenge we're hitting is communication. So, we're having parents, generally, who are outside the areas entirely saying, 'Why haven't we got this yet? Can we please get into it?', which is encouraging. But the other thing we're having is people who are within pilot authorities, where it doesn't extend to the whole authority, saying, 'Well, hold on now, we think we qualify for something under universal care, we think we qualify for something on tax credits. Why don't we qualify for this?' 'Well, you're not in the pilot area.' So, we're learning about these things, but the biggest one, I have to say, is the administrative burden, and I think that's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out.", "Hefin David AM: What is the administrative burden? What specifically is that?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: It is that sheer burden on each local authority, and each pilot area, to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility, to bring in documents to prove their eligibility, to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are, what their salary slips say. It's incredibly bureaucratic. So, yesterday, when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, we made clear that our preferred option, as put within that framework Bill, is actually to build on, and to learn from the lessons as well, the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model, where you actually have\u2014and this, by the way, is supported by local authority providers out there\u2014one system that is a centralised system, where there is clarity, that is handled, that has elements of information sharing between Government departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, and so on, so that the work is done for the parents, and the work is done for the local authorities; much cleaner, much simpler.", "Hefin David AM: How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: We are very confident. But, as I say, I'm more confident in the fact that we're actually piloting it, and phasing this in, because I think we've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere, including just over the border in England, where they have a different version of a childcare offer, but they've gone for it in a big-bang approach. And it has led to technical issues, it's led to volume issues, where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it, and the complexity, I have to say, of individual family situations, whereas what we are doing, Hefin, is taking this forward very, very carefully. Each roll-out, each expansion that we're doing of the pilot is not\u2014and I know this has caused some people to come back and say, 'Why can't we all have it now?' It's because we're only rolling out\u00a0to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it's rurality or, as it will be within\u00a0densely urban areas,\u00a0where the cost might be slightly higher, and that's allowing us to have the confidence that we'll have it. We've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd\u2014the whole of Gwynedd, Anglesey and Caerphilly. Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer.\u00a0Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September. Swansea is planning to do it, they tell us, in due course\u2014in short order\u2014as well. So, we\u00a0have the confidence now that, with that learning going on from different pilot areas, we'll have the full roll-out by 2020.", "Hefin David AM: Is it true to say that, in the early adopter areas, the intensity of demand for\u00a0the services is not spread evenly across?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely.", "Hefin David AM: And why is that? Is that going to cause a problem across Wales?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: No, it won't cause a problem. If we were doing this tomorrow, it would cause a problem, but what we're learning is that\u00a0there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues. So ,there are issues to do with\u2014. It's not capacity, by the way. We're not finding a problem here\u00a0with capacity,\u00a0whether it's in English language provision or whether it's in Welsh language provision,\u00a0whether it's in children with complex needs, we're not finding\u00a0that as an issue. But what we are finding is, for example, one of\u00a0the well-known ones\u2014and I've spoken\u00a0about\u00a0this before\u2014is that, in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies, there is a\u00a0family tradition of doing childcare\u00a0within\u00a0the families. I've done it myself. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on provide free, unregistered,\u00a0unlicensed childcare of a sort. Now that\u00a0isn't what the scheme is about, by the way, I\u00a0have to say. So, some of the aspects are cultural, but what we're also doing\u00a0alongside this, whilst looking at the capacity and looking at how we\u00a0learnt from the pilot roll-out, is that communication with\u00a0parents and providers and local authorities as well. So, we have a whole programme running alongside it. It's about communicating what the offer is, how\u00a0simple it is to get invovled in this and\u00a0where they go to, and, critically, I think, how we do that national roll-out would be important as well.", "Hefin David AM: So, given the point you've made about\u00a0grandparents and family, wouldn't it be sensible, then, to offer a subsidy to\u00a0grandparents to provide this kind of care?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Unregistered grandparents?", "Hefin David AM: Well, through some kind of analysis of that.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, we don't think so and there are good reasons behind this.", "Hefin David AM: Is it because you say that they wouldn't be registered as\u00a0carers for their own family member?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, but there's a deeper reason behind that\u00a0registration as well. The childcare offer isn't only to just provide childcare; it's the wider aspects\u00a0that come\u00a0with this.\u00a0This childcare offer ties into\u00a0the foundation years offer. There's an element of education linked to the\u00a0childcare offer\u2014there's that 10\u00a0hours of the early education foundation years as well. The two tie together. So, there's an issue here with quality, about socialisation and how children learn in an environment, as opposed to purely\u2014as great as all our grandparents and aunts and uncles are\u2014simply child-minding. That's one\u00a0important distinction. So, the\u00a0focus of this scheme is very much on registered\u00a0licensed providers, which could be, by the way\u2014because we do have them, and we're discussing this at the moment internally and with the\u00a0Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years\u00a0and others\u2014grandparents\u00a0who are actually registered and\u00a0inspected by the care inspectorate? We're having\u00a0those discussions.", "Hefin David AM: How many of them are there?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: We don't think there is a huge number, but we're trying to\u00a0bottom this out at the moment. We haven't got\u00a0the exact number, but we don't think they are huge numbers, but there are, in our constituencies, registered, licensed, inspected grandparents who look after other\u00a0people's children in a little group of four or five or six or seven, but also their own grandchildren.", "Hefin David AM: So, they're a kind of grandparents club.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes. Now that, I would say to you\u2014and I know that Darren raised this on the floor yesterday as well\u2014is markedly different in the nature of it, because it's\u00a0registered and licensed, than simply informal grandparents or aunts or uncles. I say that as well\u00a0because we also get\u00a0people who will say to us, 'I don't\u00a0want to be paid for looking after my grandchildren; I look after my grandchildren\u00a0because I look after them'.", "Hefin David AM: And what about the view, given that you said that\u00a0capacity\u00a0wasn't an issue, of the National Day Nurseries\u00a0Association, which says that Wales has the most fragile childcare sector in Great Britain?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: I don't agree we have the most fragile, but the childcare offer gives us an\u00a0opportunity to make it more\u00a0resilient and more robust. We know from the\u00a0early piloting, and as we roll it out, that there is the immense diversity\u00a0within the childcare sector, and we're talking about\u00a0everything from those very small terraced homes that have been licensed and registered to take six or seven children,\u00a0to large, complex environments that perhaps\u00a0are on maintained premises within school premises, provided by a voluntary or third sector organisation. So, there's immense complexity and we know that that differs across Wales, and we also know there's immense regional variation in the scale and the type of childcare offer. What the roll-out allows us to do, backed by \u00a360 million of capital money behind it, in terms of capital development of childcare facilities, backed by a 10-year workforce development plan for childcare\u2014and bear in mind this is bolted in as part of our foundational economy approach as well\u2014that means, by 2020, we get to the point where we're putting the money into the capital development but also to the workforce development, because\u00a0in some areas we're finding it's not to do with lack of provision and facilities, it's to do with lack of staff. In other areas, we're finding there are plenty of staff but not the adequate facilities. We've got to get it right.", "Hefin David AM: That's fair enough, but is it realistic to think that there's going to be capacity growth in the next two to three years to deliver the product? Is that realistic to think that that foundational sector can provide that level of staffing?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, I think it is, absolutely, because, again, what we're finding is we've got several things going on at once in terms of how we monitor and assess the development\u00a0of this roll-out. One is the work that we're doing on the ground with the phased roll-out, so we're literally learning live time, and I have pretty much weekly or fortnightly updates on how things are going, but also there is a termly update as well. We've also commissioned additional work from\u00a0Arad to look at this first phase of the roll-out that we've done to see what that tells us as well. But the feedback that we're getting from the childcare providers themselves, on the basis that we're now identifying where either the gaps in the workforce or the physical facilities are, is that, 'Yes, we can do this', because\u00a0we're putting the money in, we have the strategy for the workforce development, and it's not going to be the same in all parts of Wales. It's not as if what we're saying is, 'Here's what we're going to do all of a sudden\u2014flick a switch and we have a universality of the same type of provision everywhere.' So, let me give you one key example. Alongside this, alongside\u00a0the \u00a360 million capital fund, alongside\u00a0the workforce development, we've also identified a separate\u00a0strain of money into cylch meithrin. We know that there is a shortage in parts of Wales for Welsh language childcare development. We're specifically putting money into developing that, and, in fact, the first one of those will be, from\u00a0that new tranche of money, opening up, I think, in September. They anticipate, as part of our big strategy with Welsh language development, we'll have an additional 40 of those by\u2014", "Jo-Anne Daniels: Thirty.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: It's an additional 30 by 2020, and an additional doubling of that in the 10 years\u00a0after that.\u00a0We can't take this for granted, Hefin. This is difficult. This is hard work, but we have everything in place to make it happen.", "Hefin David AM: The last thing from me: the \u00a34.50 single national rate\u2014is there a danger that we might be creating a kind of EasyJet-style nursery provision where you get the basics but the wealthier parents are going to be able to pay for better care within those settings because\u00a0of the add-ons?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: We really mulled over this a lot and discussed it, I have to say, not only internally but with childcare providers out there and with parents as well and with local authorities. The\u00a0first thing to say is the \u00a34.50 rate that we've set has been welcomed, and it's been welcomed because it's unlike the much more complex offer that's in England, where there's a variable rate and there are lots of determining factors on it and it's added complexity\u00a0and confusion.", "Hefin David AM: Can I just ask there, it's been welcomed perhaps\u00a0in Blaenau Gwent, but has it been equally welcomed in Cardiff?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: No, because\u00a0we haven't rolled it out in Cardiff yet, and that is a salient point.", "Hefin David AM: Okay, fair enough. But will it be, then?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, it will be. Some of the more expensive areas like Cardiff and Newport are knocking on our door saying, 'Please can we have this offer?', and we are keen to give it to them. But, as I say\u2014", "Hefin David AM: But do you anticipate\u00a0a capacity\u00a0problem with the \u00a34.50 in those areas, compared to, say, the Cynon valley?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: We can't anticipate\u00a0it yet,\u00a0Hefin, but that's exactly the reason\u00a0for going into that area and then assessing how it works. We're reasonably confident that the \u00a34.50\u2014. We're reasonably assured by the feedback that we're having that the \u00a34.50 might work as a universal amount. But if we learn, when we roll it out in Cardiff and Newport, that there needs to be some variation, we can look at that, because we're not doing a big-bang approach. So, that is part of why we will move to roll it out within Cardiff and Newport and other more expensive areas and learn from it, but at the moment, I have to say, the \u00a34.50 amount has been welcomed\u2014it's appropriate. You touched on the other aspect, though, of the wider aspects of beyond the \u00a34.50, because\u00a0the \u00a34.50 doesn't cover everything.\u00a0The \u00a34.50 is a contribution\u00a0towards the wraparound childcare element but it doesn't cover\u2014and we agonised over this\u2014the issues of things like transport out on trips or food or snacks and things like this. Now, we did agonise a number of things that brought us to the conclusion where we are. I have to say, this hasn't been ivory-tower stuff; it's been in discussion with the providers but also parents.\u00a0One: parents are quite used to\u2014with childcare settings and play care settings and so on\u2014the idea that providers are quite different. Some providers charge a fee that does everything in one; others provide simply the childcare element but they tell the parents\u2014and I'm used to this as a parent myself, although mine are older now\u2014'Mr Irranca-Davies, when you sign on, just to be aware, if we do take your kids down to St Fagans, there's going to be a little bit of a charge for that' and so on.", "Hefin David AM: That's fair enough, but it would be the lowest-income working families who would be most unduly affected by that, because the higher income families would be able to afford those add-ons, the lower income ones won't. Isn't that a concern?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: If money was absolutely no object, then I think you'd be looking at quite a different offer, but it has to be affordable within what we've got as well. The fact that parents, including those who are on lower incomes, are used to currently discriminating between providers, not only with childcare settings but also within school settings as well, where very often schools now will say, 'We're doing something extra'\u2014", "Hefin David AM: That may be the case, but it's not fair, is it?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: In a pure argument about equity, and if funding was no object and if the burdens of austerity were released and we were told we had money\u2014'You can do what you want'\u2014I think you'd be looking at a very different approach. But within what we have, I think this works very, very well indeed, because it's very transparent for parents who are used to making these decisions. It says, 'Here you have 10 hours of the foundation education offer. You have the additional hours here provided with the childcare offer. But\u00a0within those additional hours, you may be with a local provider in the middle of Powys that actually says, \"Within that we provide everything\"; you may be with a provider that says, \"Well, actually, we do a whistles and bells thing and we take them out on trips, but it's up to you if you want to come, and here's the additional cost\u2014\".' Parents are used to making that decision and realistically, in terms of what we can do with this offer, this is actually\u2014the arguments around this have been well rehearsed both with providers and with parents and we're not getting any concerns that this is going to unnecessarily\u00a0disadvantage. In a total fairness argument, would you make it universal and with no additional charges? Well, possibly you would. But we work within the realistic\u2014", "Hefin David AM: Or have a lower top-end income limit.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Depending on how the Bill progresses in the main Chamber and when it goes through committee, there's that flexibility built into the Bill that those things can be looked at over time and adjusted. For the moment, I think there is an attraction, in terms of the upper limit, of saying: one\u2014'Let's try not to add additional complexity, let's go with a scheme that's already working its way through the system, which is, if you like, what they're doing in England, and not add additional complexity. But, secondly, there is an appeal to universality, curiously, in saying to all parents\u2014and I say this regardless of political hues across the committee here\u2014there's an attraction when you say, 'Let's make an offer focused on working parents as it is', as universal to those working parents as possible, and avoid the administrative costs of saying, 'Well, let's take the upper limit down to \u00a380 or \u00a360 or \u00a355.' There's always the question of how much additional cost is incurred in actually doing that tweak of complexity. We have looked at it.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Darren on this.", "Darren Millar AM: Just to ask, I mean, the labour market costs are changing, aren't they? You've got the national living wage increasing\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014that's going to have a bearing, isn't it, on the affordability of this project in terms of the childcare offer and the suitability of the \u00a34.50 per hour regime? By the time it's fully rolled out, of course, that \u00a34.50 rate is going to be a number of years old, for example. Do you have plans to review that? Where is it headed? Because it's certainly not going to be enough in the future.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: It depends how far in the future you're looking. I have to say, the feedback that we're having at the moment from organisations like the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years and from the National Day Nurseries Association Wales and others is that this is the right rate and it's suitable not only today but for the foreseeable\u00a0future of rolling this out.", "Darren Millar AM: But they've raised concerns about the national living\u00a0wage implications, haven't they, as well?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Of course, and I think it's incumbent on us as well to not\u2014", "Darren Millar AM: So, it's not fair to say that they haven't raised concerns about the rate.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, but what they're not arguing for at the moment is for this rate to be raised.", "Darren Millar AM: But they have suggested that in meetings\u2014", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: That in future\u2014", "Darren Millar AM: Absolutely.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, of course, in future, any Minister, any committee, will want to come back and look at\u2014is the hourly rate, as one element of the scheme, appropriate to the current financial challenges for the sector, and not least, by the way, as we try not only to develop the workforce, but to develop the career pathways through this as well? And I think that's the right discussion to be had, live time, as this is taken forward. But at this moment in time, we're not getting people saying within this part of the roll-out that we need to adjust this amount.", "Darren Millar AM: So, have you forecasted\u00a0for any adjustment in the rate going forward in terms of affordability of the project? Because\u00a0you've still got this \u00a3100 million price tag on it, haven't you?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Similar to the point that was raised with Hefin about Cardiff and Newport, if we identify that the rate is not appropriate, if it's\u2014. I don't think anybody's going to come back to us and say that it's too little. But do bear in mind that it's above where the average England rate is, even though there's this complex variability\u00a0within the English\u00a0rate that has caused some confusion there, which is why the universal rate with us has been welcomed. If we find, as we pilot it, or if we find because\u00a0there are more expensive areas for it to be delivered in, there needs to be adjustment, then we'll be back in front of the committee arguing why that needs to be the case.", "Darren Millar AM: But that won't put the project at risk in terms of its finances?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: No, no. We are still very confident, looking forward, on the best projections we have, fed by the live input that's coming in from the pilot, which will be fed again in the autumn\u2014the Arad\u00a0report coming forward\u2014that we have not only the capacity to actually deliver this\u2014challenging as this is, we have the capacity to deliver it\u2014but also that the funding that's available, on our best estimate\u2014the estimate we've stood by, that broad ball park of that \u00a3100 million figure\u2014it's deliverable within that. But if it changes, we will come back. And if it changes, I'll have to be sitting down with my boss, Vaughan Gething, and with Mark Drakeford, to argue the case on it. But at this moment, we have confidence and we've run the rule across\u00a0this repeatedly. But that rate, combined with the other elements of this childcare offer\u2014there is sufficient there allocated to actually deliver the whole roll-out.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Mark on this.", "Mark Reckless AM: Minister, as a parent who's been researching childcare options, it's obvious to me that in Cardiff, and to a degree in Newport and Monmouthshire, costs are substantially higher than this, and I haven't\u00a0been able to find anywhere that has a six-hour day for \u00a327, which is implied by your rate. Isn't it the case that rents and wages are higher and therefore you're going to need a higher rate to make it work? Isn't that already obvious? Why are you postponing coming back and looking at this until some point in the future?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Chair, my biggest fear is a parent who's actually involved in this area already, but, having been one myself\u2014. Mark, you may be right, that's exactly why we're piloting it and that's why when we pilot in Cardiff and Newport, we know we have lessons to learn over the affordability\u00a0and the \u00a34.50 per hour rate.", "Mark Reckless AM: But you're not piloting it in any of the high-cost areas that I've referred to.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: No. We will be. We are going to be.", "Mark Reckless AM: When are you starting?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Cardiff and Newport\u2014September.", "Owain Lloyd: This September.", "Mark Reckless AM: This September?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes. So, we're not missing any of these learning\u00a0experiences and we know that\u2014. The reason we've gone for the other areas first, by the way\u2014please take this back to any authorities affected\u2014is simply because we've done deep dives into areas that vary from very rural areas in mid Wales, areas in north Wales, areas around Welsh language provision, areas in deep valleys, understanding\u00a0the cultural and the economic impacts. So, we've held back a little bit from going into what we know is an obvious challenge within the more expensive areas of provision. But it's coming, it's imminent, and we'll learn the lessons from it. And do you know, you may be right? And if you are right, that it's more expensive, and we need a higher rate within\u00a0those areas, then we're going to have to come back and discuss it with the committee. But let's go in and learn it first of all, rather than assume it necessarily.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Just before I bring David in on the issue that Hefin raised about the chargeable\u00a0items, your paper says that providers can charge up to \u00a37.50 a day for food, snacks, transport and consumables such as nappies. Now, that's \u00a337.50 a week, which is a lot of money for parents, and I just wondered if you wanted to comment on that figure?\u00a0But also, do you think there's a risk\u00a0that providers who maybe aren't charging at the moment may start charging because of any new pressures that arise because of this scheme?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: I think they're the right areas to flag up, and if I thought that was going to happen I'd be concerned as we take this forward and design this scheme. I think part of the evaluation from Arad will also show us that\u2014whether or not, within the pilot areas that we are already in, which are quite diverse, that is happening. We're only one term into learning the lessons, by the way, but I would want to make sure that we design a scheme where we are not heaping on disadvantage or where there was exploitation of disadvantaged families. So, the early evaluation, I think, will give us good feedback on that. I think also, by the way, that providers know that this is a collaborative effort to do this here. It's not in their interests, I have to say, as the umbrella bodies or individual providers, to see this as some way that they can unduly rake in additional income from this on the backs of poorer families. This is about providing opportunities for all working families. But especially, I have to say, the early evaluation that we've seen already suggests that the greatest proportion of those who are taking advantage of this scheme in the early parts\u2014in the early evaluation\u2014are those who are below the average working wage within in Wales. That's by far the greatest number of people who are doing it, and we don't want them then being priced out because of add-ons. So, there has to be some pragmatism, I have to say, and some open partnership working here with the sector, and we do have that.", "Lynne Neagle AM: John on this.", "John Griffiths AM: I want to come back to the \u00a34.50 rate, but in terms of working with the sector, briefly, if I might, Chair, I just wonder, Huw, in terms of that \u00a34.50 figure and understanding the sector in Wales, to what extent are we talking about a market rate and to what extent are we talking about the increase in demand that will come from the scheme and how that relates to economies of scale and capacity? Is it purely a market rate or is there a conversation with the sector in terms of the benefits that will come from this scheme and how they should be recognised in terms of setting the rate?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: This has been a very open dialogue with the sector around affordability, around the hourly rate and around what might happen in future as well. This is not a pure hard data-driven analysis that says, 'Here we've calculated everything and this is the rate that will satisfy it', because we recognise that there's great diversity in provision out there, and we also recognise that things will change over time. It's not only the geographical diversity\u2014it's the diversity of the sector itself. I think we need to, as we take this scheme forward and look at the full roll-out, continue in that very open dialogue with the sector not about what is purely a market-driven amount but actually what is also affordable for the Welsh Government within the constraints that we have. Just to flag up one issue, it's right that we're focusing on those elements that aren't included within it, to some extent as well, and the effect of that on more disadvantaged families, but that has to be balanced with the pocket of affordability for this scheme as well. Let me give you a clear illustration: some of our calculations have suggested that if we included free food within this offer as well, it would add something like in the region of 50p to that \u00a34.50 rate. That would have, at this moment, impacts on the affordability of this and the roll-out of it. I would need to be going back to my seniors and arguing the case now, okay? But, it's that open dialogue with the sector that says, 'There's one thing about what you're saying you demand as a market; there's another thing about what we're saying that we have affordability from taxpayers' money to actually put into this'. They also understand, John, that as well as an enabling policy\u2014and we're seeing the evidence, by the way; I can cite it\u2014of individuals who are being helped into more flexible options to get back into work, increase their hours and so on, this is also about building capacity in a fundamental foundation sector that is in every single part of Wales. The stuff that's being debated ad nauseam here within the Assembly about foundational sectors\u2014. The sector itself understands that if we boost the childcare offer in all its diversity, including, by the way, not just the independent sector but social enterprises and third-sector organisations, such as exist in Neath and elsewhere that I was involved\u00a0in 20 or 30-odd years ago setting up\u2014that has an economic impact that goes beyond that immediate family who are receiving the provision to the wider communities as well. They know that. They know there is job creation within this and there's economic impact for that. So, it's an open dialogue on what the rate should be rather than purely, 'Our wonks have crunched the numbers and we've come up with \u00a34.50.'", "Lynne Neagle AM: David, you had a question on the pilots.", "David Rees AM: Yes, just to finish that section off, if I may, Chair. Before I go to my question, I want to come back to Mark Reckless's question and the answer you gave. I got the impression that if there is a need to look at different rates because of the higher-end areas, you may therefore have different sets of rates and not a universal rate. Is that also on the cards?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: David, it's possible. I think our preference would be, I have to say, to stick with the universal rate, because we know it's\u2014. There's real simplicity and it's been welcomed in the sector. But the sector, also, are quite pragmatic about this. One of the defining hallmarks of the way that we've taken this scheme forward is learning in live time as we pilot and expand the pilots into different areas and different types of provision. If we learn lessons from that that suggest we need to come back and look at a differential in more-expensive-to-provide areas, then we'll have to look at that, but there might be other ways of splicing it. But first of all, I think we have to go in and see how does this work. We might find, Mark, we might find, David, that we go in and when everything is tallied up, the \u00a34.50 per hour works in supporting provision there.", "David Rees AM: Okay. In your answer to John, you talked about affordability, which I totally understand. If I can now remind you: I don't remember the word 'affordability' coming in the manifesto pledge of the Government. It was 'we will offer childcare facilities'. So, I just want to put a reminder to you there.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Ministers always look at affordability.", "David Rees AM: Well, voters don't. In the situation regarding Welsh-medium, you answered that a little bit earlier, but I have concerns about capacity. Workforce capacity you've mentioned. To actually be registered you need staff who are qualified. There's clearly a need to get more staff, because in your own paper you say that the report in 2016 said you do not have the childcare capacity in Wales at the moment. Do you believe that you can actually deliver the workforce to meet that capacity, first of all through the English medium, but secondly through the Welsh medium as well? Because there's a clear need to look at it. You talk about 30 by 2020. By the way, 30 is nothing big when you consider the whole of Wales. Do you actually think you've got that workforce capacity set up before this is fully rolled out?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: I hope, Chair, you'll appreciate that in our submission to you we've been very open. This is challenging. This is. To get to where we want to go is a huge challenge. Can we do it? Yes we can. And I don't say that glibly. Let me suggest some of the ways why. We have confidence that we can do this if everybody is working together across the sector, across the local authorities. Let me talk broadly about capacity, first of all, including English and Welsh-medium provision for children with complex needs, provision for children with disabilities\u2014all of this. First of all, this is being\u2014. The work that we're doing to increase both capacity in terms of trained staff and qualified staff: we have the 10-year plan that I mentioned, which has already been announced. We're working through it. We're working through it with the sector. So, we're identifying not only broadly at a national level where we need to develop those qualifications, but also at a regional, geographic level as well, and that's being taken forward. We've engaged with the 22 authorities\u2014not just the pilot areas as well on this. So, beyond the pilot areas, we also have intense engagement. As you can see from what I've said before, it's rolling out progressively, but with all 22 authorities we're working with them on their childcare sufficiency assessments to identify where their shortages are.", "David Rees AM: What have the pilot programmes actually shown you about this, and how are you going to move this forward?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, it's precisely that. So, within the pilot areas, we have a greater depth of analysis now of where both the workforce and the physical provisions are. Whether those are maintained or non-maintained or third sector or school facilities or whatever, we've got a much deeper granulation of identifying where that is, and we're working, then, with those authorities, with the capital moneys that we've allocated to this and the workforce development, and with local colleges, to develop the workforce and the physical constraints. But we're also doing that with the other 22, with all the 22 authorities as well, in anticipation of the wider roll-out. They're not being left out of this. And by the way, it's not only the Cardiffs and the Newports; it's all the other ones where there isn't full roll-out. We're engaged with them deeply at the moment with that analysis on their childcare sufficiency assessments, both in terms of workforce, but also physical provision. So, we're doing that already. We are looking as well, as this is rolled out, around the issue of co-location. Now, co-location is a fruitful way to look at future development. It doesn't mean, by the way, that we exclude the third sector or social enterprise approach, or the independent sector, but co-location could be key to the roll-out of this in the right areas where it can be done, because then we avoid any\u00a0fracture between the education hours and the childcare hours: the physical transportation of children from one location to another. So, we're engaged with the 22 authorities on that: where could that be developed, who would be the providers that would do it and do they have the workforce to scale up to do it? If not, how do they talk to local colleges to do that? So, we're doing that at the moment. I mentioned we've put the \u00a31 million additional funding into the meithrin over the next two years, targeting\u00a040 new Welsh-medium groups by 2021, which pretty much coincides with the full roll-out of this. It's part of the aim of an additional 150 over the next decade of meithrin. So, all of those things, David, give us a confidence that we're going to be in the right place.", "David Rees AM: But in particular, take the Welsh language\u2014I understand Gwynedd, and I won't ask another question on that for obvious reasons at this point in time\u2014but in some of the other areas where you've piloted, you've gone partial in some areas. When there's Welsh language education, and the three to five-year-olds go to schools, they go from all areas of the council, basically. They don't actually go necessarily from the local area, and therefore you're getting a different picture. Have you been able to assess the actual impact, properly, upon the Welsh-medium side of things? Because, for example, my grandchildren will go from my area, which may not be in one of the considerations, to a school that may be in that consideration, and that happens regularly.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely. We know that historically we've got, across the country, a shortage of Welsh-language childcare provision\u2014meithrin and so on\u2014but we have not only a strategy in place, but the fact that we've got local authorities now doing their own assessments within their area, across the piste of childcare, but also in terms of Welsh language, that means then that we can start filling those gaps with the money we've put to it, and that includes in all parts of Wales, including those areas within south Wales and others that are less deep in their tradition of speaking Welsh over recent history, anyway, but where the demand for it is massive. So, local authorities are tasked with doing their own assessments of childcare sufficiency for this childcare offer. They're identifying the gaps, David, and we will work with them and with providers to fill those gaps, and that includes with the umbrella organisations for Welsh language childcare provision.", "David Rees AM: And that's the same for those children with physical disabilities or learning disabilities.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely the same. Absolutely the same. And this does mean, Chair, that it will be different, as it currently is in different areas: the type of provision, where the provision is located. But the provision should be there. This offer won't happen unless the provision is there for those children with complex needs, children with disabilities, Welsh language provision, as well as more generic provision as well, but it will be diverse in its provision around areas.", "Lynne Neagle AM: I do want to move on now, John, so if I can come back to your question. Llyr.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: I would like to pick up on the last point, if I may.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you. The investment in meithrin, of course, is one that we all welcome. A question from me though, the wider question, is: how do we mainstream Welsh medium into childcare? Because, clearly, leaving it to meithrin is one way of doing it, but there's a lot of existing infrastructure out there that we need to upskill in terms of the provision of Welsh medium. So, it's not a question as such, but I'm sure you recognise that\u2014that there is a challenge there. Because if we are to get to where we want to get to, it isn't about growing meithrin, or Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin; it's about mainstreaming Welsh-medium provision within the wider sector. So, it wasn't a question after all. So, looking at the manifesto commitment that was made in 2016, clearly the main or the principal aim of this policy is around removing some of the barriers to secure employment for parents, albeit with very positive outcomes for the children themselves, and we don't ignore or neglect that at any cost. But I'm just wondering: how would you then reconcile that with the findings of the Public Policy Institute for Wales report, which I mentioned to you yesterday, which was commissioned by the Government to look at policy options in this context, which concluded that there will be no 'substantial impacts on net income, poverty or work behaviour for families with children' and that 'the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers in families with a child of target age is extremely small'?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, the first thing I would say is that what we're learning from the pilots is that it is having real-life impacts on parents, including in disadvantaged families, and we're having this fed back from real-life situations on the ground, where parents are making different choices in the areas where it's being piloted. So, the types of different choices they're making could be to expand the number of hours that they're in work, because they now have a choice, they're not constrained to certain hours or whatever, they have a wider choice, with a wider number of providers, and they're making that decision and they're able to expand their hours. Some, by the way, Llyr,\u00a0I have to say\u2014and, again, these are real-life situations\u2014are saying, 'What we're doing is not expanding our hours, but, because of the increased provision of childcare and the increased offer, we are now able to actually spend more time with our children, because we're adjusting our hours of work, based on the childcare provision offer.'\u00a0That in itself, I have to say, is a worthy aim. But I would say what we found out, in real-life examples\u2014I'm not saying that in direct contrast to what that paper was saying\u2014", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: That's what I was going to ask; it sounds as if you're saying they were wrong.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: But what we have is the advantage of this phased roll-out, where we are learning, live time, and I think the Arad report in October\u2014we're hoping to see the final report in October\u2014will help put some flesh on this as well. It is already having an effect: the majority of parents who are taking advantage of this are actually in those groups that are below the average wage, they are making positive choices to get into this offer and to either expand, take more hours, adjust their own lifestyles around it or more. So, it's having a positive effect. I can cite to you examples, because I've asked my own officials on this, of families who tell us they're saving up to \u00a3250 a week on the basis of this offer within the pilot areas, who've increased their hours of employment, who've changed their working patterns to suit their work life, but also to suit their families. Now, that's real stuff, as opposed to\u2014yes.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: So, in effect, you are saying that the PPIW\u00a0report got it wrong, basically.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: No, I'm not saying that they got it wrong and it's wholly wrong, but it is interesting, within that report, that it did identify that there were a range of factors here that play upon this. It's not only the childcare; it is the transport, it's the training and education, it's the employment support and all of those. And we agree with that, but we do think, and what we're seeing, live time, at the moment\u2014maybe at some point, somebody else will produce a report beyond the Arad\u00a0report in October that will say, 'Well, actually, the way this is designed, that they've done it in Wales, is having a material effect on those families, particularly the most disadvantaged families.'", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: But you're asking us to support a Bill here, albeit a framework Bill, to achieve a policy aim where you're giving us anecdotal evidence that it's having an impact, contrary to research that's previously been done, albeit with promises that, maybe, an evaluation sometime in the autumn might tell us a different story.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: We know, and we are constantly told\u2014I'm sure this is commonplace in constituency surgeries, as well\u2014by parents who say that the biggest mitigating factor for them, actually, either going into work at an earlier opportunity or expanding their hours is purely the cost of childcare in front of them. We are picking up, even from the early term of the analysis\u2014. I think our further reports, both Arad and as we go forward with the pilots, will substantiate this more. It'll go beyond the anecdotal, it will show that parents are having an enhanced opportunity to balance their work life, to make better choices, either in terms of expanding the number of hours they're working and increasing their disposable income within their families, or actually making it simply better for them in their family situation, where they don't currently have that offer. So, I get the fact that we have one report out there, but it's one report. It's a report, and we're not dismissing it entirely, but what we are saying is: we are now working with real-life piloting of an offer, and we are seeing the benefits coming through. As we roll this out, we'll be back in front of this committee saying, 'Well, this is now what we're finding. We can go beyond the real-life stories that I'm relating to you now, and we can say, \"Well, here's some hard data that goes with this, as well.\"'", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. You reference in your paper, as well, another report, which is the\u00a0Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u00a0report, 'Starting Strong 2017', and it highlights countries that have, maybe, the most similar childcare offer to what's being proposed here in Wales. I'm just wondering what assessment you've made of those similarities, because, clearly, there'll be different economic contexts in different countries and different levels of public expenditure, et cetera.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: We haven't done really detailed analysis of comparisons with other countries far from Wales, but we will be doing work\u00a0that will be doing some benchmarking against, where we can find similar models, where appropriate\u2014do some appropriate benchmarking. What we have been doing is looking at what's been happening across the border in England and trying to learn from the lessons there, and also the offer in Scotland as well, which are both close to hand. They're in quite similar contexts. But we will do some work, Llyr, around benchmarking against good comparative international examples, where appropriate.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Yes, there we are, because one of my concerns was that the focus in a number of the countries in the OECD report are for nought to three-year-olds, whereas, of course, the policy focus here is for a slightly older age group.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, and I fully get that, but again, and I know it can be said, 'Well, this is an example' but it's real-life examples. We are having people who are telling us that they're now making the choice to go to work earlier because\u00a0this is extended to three-year-olds, but they would have delayed. There is a direct outcome\u00a0there if this childcare offer enables somebody to say, 'Well, I'm going to go a year earlier back into work and bring income into the family.'", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. So, moving on, then, to the impact on the child and this whole question around school readiness, of course, which is an important one to address. Clearly, one of the main outcomes of this policy will be the academic performance of children, hopefully, later on in life. I want to come back to this point that the Children's Commissioner for Wales and others have raised: the concern that, actually, the most disadvantaged\u2014those from workless households\u2014are being excluded from this policy. Isn't there therefore a risk that they'll be left even further behind?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: I've had long, detailed and positive discussions with the children's commissioner on this, and I know the children's commissioner would want a more universal offer, but I make two points on that: one is, that was not what the commitment in the manifesto was, and it's not the offer that's being taken forward now. It is a different thing, a universal offer, and there\u00a0are issues around that with complexity, and also affordability. But it isn't the offer that we took forward into Government; this is what we're taking forward. But it is interesting\u00a0in terms of that aspect of families then who lose out. I'd say two significant things on it: one is, this doesn't stand alone purely as 30 hours of childcare. Within this, there are 10 hours of the foundation years, educational input, which is there for everybody. But before that, particularly for those disadvantaged families, before we even get to that stage, you have schemes such as Flying Start, and I know this committee has looked in detail at Flying Start and has said that it would like to see it rolled out everywhere. If I had all the money under the sun, I would really do that, Chair; I would really do it. But I don't have all the money under the sun.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: But you do have the ability to target the money.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, but the fact that Flying Start, we know, is leading to those outcomes where those children, in quite challenged circumstances very often, are more ready to step up to the foundation year, are more ready, then, to step through into mainstream education in later years\u2014those things tie together. So, there are the 10 hours of education provision that sits here for every family, by the way, within this offer, let alone the childcare. That doesn't mean that everybody's excluded, but it does mean, yes, that this offer is focused on working parents. And we don't think that that's a bad thing. In fact, it does overlap with other offers that other political parties were taking forward into the last election, which was focusing on how we support the biggest thing that we often have in our constituency mailbags, which is, 'I can't afford to go back to work because I can't afford the childcare. Don't tell me to go back to work, I can't afford it.'", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: The majority of disadvantaged children don't live in Flying Start areas, do they?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, indeed.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: So, there's a missing cohort there that can't access one or the other, and the school readiness gap is growing, and, really, are we focusing our resources in the right place here?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, yes, in terms of this scheme, but it doesn't sit alone as this scheme\u2014it's the wider plethora of, I have to say, progressive and advanced initiatives that we have in Wales that take different\u00a0forms. It's not only Flying Start that provides that other support for parents, and readiness not only for the parents and for their children, but also the support into work. So, if, for example, you look at the Parents, Childcare and Employment programme, which is separate from this, there is support there for every parent in terms of helping them get supported into work from disadvantaged families. If you look at the support for the children, we've got the 10 hours that sits within the sphere of the education, but we've also got all the other family intervention programmes that help with socialisation, education and so on and so forth. If you look at this solely on its own and say, 'Well, there is nothing else there;\u00a0the rest of Wales is a desert and there's no support for parents, for getting parents back into work or for\u00a0those parents who are not seeking to go back into work but also need the support and for their children in education',\u00a0I'd be worried. But, actually, this fits as part of the jigsaw that we have in Wales, where I think we are well ahead of the other nations. Yes, we could do more, and I always say, Llyr; I always say, Chair, that if I had\u2014I don't have a chequebook at all, because it's not in my gift\u2014if I had a blank cheque I'd do a lot more, but we don't. But what we can do is get the right schemes in place, and if this helps drive more choices for working parents, including, by the way\u2014.\u00a0There are niceties within this as well; it doesn't have to be that both parents are working. You could have a parent who is on incapacity benefit. You could have a parent who is a registered carer. They would qualify for the scheme. Those will be some of those most disadvantaged families that we both have those concerns about. So, there is some flexibility within this scheme as well to deal with some of those disadvantaged families.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Darren on this.", "Darren Millar AM: I am surprised by the answer there,\u00a0particularly given that one of the ambitions of the Government is to close this attainment gap later in life when schoolchildren get to their examinations, when they're 16 years old. Yet this appears to be driving a bigger wedge in terms of development, which could, of course, lead to a perverse outcome later on in life, but I don't want to ask you about that. If I can just very quickly ask you: has consideration been given to making free childcare available to parents where they're in 16 hours or more of education each week? So, they may not be entering the labour market, but, of course, one of those barriers to them getting back into the labour market could well be their education, so what arrangements are in place there?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Darren, we have considered it, and we haven't included it within the scheme because this is designed to enable parents to go into work, not into training to enable them to get into work. There are other forms of support available for parents in terms of college and so on and so forth, but it's not this scheme.", "Darren Millar AM: But it's not prescribed support, is it? You know, it's not universally available to people who might be wanting to get back into the labour market over that barrier. You must have done some costings, then, if you've considered it, and you must have tried to identify numbers.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: I'm looking to my left and my right.", "Owain Lloyd: Not at this point.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: We haven't\u2014", "Darren Millar AM: So, you haven't considered it that much, have you?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: We have actually considered\u2014. We consider it from the point of, 'What is this scheme set up to do?' It's very clear. When we ran, in the manifesto on this point\u2014", "Darren Millar AM: I understand that. I don't want you to repeat yourself because I know we are against the clock. But, very specifically, when you say you've considered it, what you mean is you thought about it but you've not costed it, you've not identified the numbers that might be involved\u2014", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely, absolutely.", "Darren Millar AM: And therefore you've not considered whether it might be affordable in addition to the policy objective that this is trying to meet.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: No, Darren, you're right: we haven't considered affordability because we've considered it on first principles to do with what this offer is trying to do. It doesn't fit within the offer so, as such, why would we do the costings?", "Darren Millar AM: Perhaps I can frame my question in another way. Are you prepared to consider it if you're able to identify the numbers and potential cost?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Ah, right, okay.\u00a0We'd be interested in your thoughts as a committee, but it doesn't actually fit within the first principles of what the\u00a0scheme is designed to do. Darren, can I just pick up on your point, in case you misinterpreted what I was saying to Llyr?\u00a0I drew attention in my answer to Llyr\u00a0to schemes such as the PaCE scheme.\u00a0In Gwynedd,\u00a0one of our pilot areas, they\u00a0are combining the Team Around the Family with this childcare offer. So, what they are doing is wrapping the support around. It is not the case, as you've suggested then, that there is somehow more disadvantage being heaped on other families. What this does is tie in in those pilot areas with the existing provision, and that's\u00a0the way we want to see it work. So, I wouldn't want you to be under any misapprehension that this makes conditions worse for families. Those families who have a registered carer in them where one parent works, and those families who have somebody on incapacity benefit will qualify for the scheme.\u00a0All families will qualify for the 10 hours\u00a0of education. In Gwynedd, they're wrapping the Team Around the Family with this offer\u2014", "Darren Millar AM: But on the other hand, Minister, you've also suggested that this will accelerate child development for those kids who are able to access it, and yet not all kids will be able to access it, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: But all children can access the 10 hours, and they can access Flying Start\u2014", "Darren Millar AM: But 10 hours is very different to 30 hours, is it not?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, but they can access Flying Start or they can access the Team Around the Family\u2014", "Darren Millar AM: If they're in a Flying Start area.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: \u2014or they can be in a children's zone area or they can\u2014", "Darren Millar AM: If they're in those areas.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Right, I've got John and then David, and the questions and answers are going to have to be brief, please.", "John Griffiths AM: Yes, certainly, Chair. In terms of child development and how this fits with wider\u00a0Welsh Government strategy, Huw,\u00a0I'd be interested in what you'd have to say about the quality of childcare.\u00a0We're talking a lot about quantity, but obviously we want to up quality, and that's recognised by Welsh Government. They've talked about increasing the qualifications within the workforce, and the quality. I just wonder how that sits within the \u00a34.50, because there could be pressures in the opposite direction there, and some tension between wanting to up the qualifications and quality of workforce whilst keeping affordability in place.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: John, you're absolutely right, and two things on that: I visited one of the facilities in the Valleys the other day that was taking this forward\u2014a very good independent sector-run childcare provision, with Welsh language and English language running alongside each other, and I asked the point about the integration, curiously, but\u00a0what they were doing was\u2014. Their standard of staff was an exemplar of what we'd want to see: not only very well-qualified childcare staff who were qualified within not simply the child-minding but the wider child development aspects\u2014. So, it was hard to differentiate, in some ways, what was happening there from what would be happening in a child development educational surrounding, and including the nutritional stuff and all of that. Now, that is the model we need to see, and the \u00a34.50 seems to work, at the moment, for that. It'll be interesting, as we discussed previously, as it goes forward\u2014. We need to look at whether that works, going forward. But the quality, I think, is key, and that's why we're focused very much on registered inspected providers, as opposed to every Tom, Dick and Harriet.", "John Griffiths AM: If we want to increase salary levels, though, which I think is a necessary part of this picture of improving quality, then obviously that might impact on the \u00a34.50 rate.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, indeed, and we are cognisant\u2014. It's interesting that we focus on whether the \u00a34.50 is affordable, but the \u00a34.50\u2014you know, we're having an interesting discussion internally about how that \u00a34.50 offer per hour sits alongside others, such as the foundation phase offer, and it's more generous. So, I think it's: how do we align, as time goes by, the child development aspects of the whole early years stuff? Now, we're doing some fascinating work that I think I've referred to on this committee before about aligning the early years development entirely. Now, this is an evolving piece of work, but I think the childcare offer should ultimately fit within that. How do you make sure that every offer that is Government-funded works on child development? It's not simply childcare.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. Right. The next questions are from Mark.", "Mark Reckless AM: In terms of child development and not accentuating disadvantage, another area where this may apply is the kids who are born in the summer term, compared to those who are born in Michaelmas. There's a lot of evidence to suggest that they start with a disadvantage at school and often don't make that up, even as they go through school. What is the rationale for providing the older children with five terms of this, compared to three terms for the younger children who already have the relative disadvantage?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: I'm looking to my colleagues here and\u2014", "Jo-Anne Daniels: Well, the criteria for eligibility for the offer are the term after the child's third birthday, which is equivalent to the eligibility criteria for the foundation phase early education offer. Clearly, then, the number of terms that a child is able to, or parents are able to, access the childcare offer will be influenced by when the child is born,\u00a0but I think you may be referring to a sort of parallel question, which is about whether\u2014. There have been questions raised about whether children who are summer-born should, in fact, start school in the term after they turn four, or whether actually they should be allowed the flexibility to start school at a later age, which I know is something that has been tested in England, and there is some mixed evidence about school starting age and the birth month of children.", "Mark Reckless AM: Well, they do have flexibility. You don't have to start your kids until the term following when they're five. That's the compulsory school\u2014", "Jo-Anne Daniels: Well, that's the legal position, but, obviously, in practice, most children will start school in the term after they're four.", "Mark Reckless AM: So, given the disadvantage we know that the younger children born in the summer have, relative to the older ones, why accentuate that by giving the older kids five terms of this project, which you tell us will have such positive effects on their child development, but the summer kids only get three? Doesn't\u00a0that make the situation worse?", "Jo-Anne Daniels: I'm not 100 per cent sure I understand the question. So, children will stop being in receipt\u00a0of the childcare offer once they become eligible for a full-time school place, and most children will become eligible for a full-time school place in the term after their fourth birthday.", "Mark Reckless AM: But the older kids become eligible for this five terms before they start school, where the younger kids, who're already disadvantaged, become eligible for it only three terms before, accentuating the problem, surely. Could more thought be given to this issue?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: We'll take that away. It's confused us a little bit, but we'll take that away. We might need to come back to you and\u2014. Yes.", "Lynne Neagle AM: If you could write to us about that, that would be helpful.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes.", "Mark Reckless AM: Thank you. Minister, you got, or Welsh Government, really, got the Public Policy Institute for Wales to study this proposed policy and they concluded that it would have no substantial impacts on net income, poverty or work behaviour for families with children, and that the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers and families with a child of target age is extremely small. What do you say to that?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, Mark, I can only refer to what\u00a0I said earlier. Our real-life evidence that is accumulating now is showing us examples of where people are making savings and increasing disposable income\u2014as I mentioned earlier, up to \u00a3250 per week within some poorer households; so, real-life examples\u2014but also where it's enabling them to make much better choices about when they work because there's more childcare offer available, or, alternatively, to work their childcare provision and their working hours around being able to spend more time with their children, which they currently can't do.", "Lynne Neagle AM: And I don't want to go back over Llyr's questions.", "Mark Reckless AM: I understand. That's not my focus. I just wondered about the quality of this PPIW piece of work. They said if you had a work requirement, as you do, it would cost \u00a361 million a year on their numbers, substantially less than you're saying, and then they said it would cost \u00a3144 million without a work requirement. Now, that implies to me that 57 per cent of the parents wouldn't be working and would continue not working even if there is this available with a work requirement. I mean, are those numbers really credible from PPIW?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: It's not quite comparing like with like. Just to draw your attention, Mark, and the committee's attention to that the PPIW analysis was looking at a provision of 38 weeks. Ours is a 48-week option. And the fact that we are having parents already saying to us that their ability to actually extend that into the 48 weeks\u2014beyond the term time and so on\u2014carries advantages that are not picked up in that report.", "Mark Reckless AM: And what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: I think, from recollection, we're one term in, so we're one term into the assessment, and I mentioned earlier that the majority of parents are below the average income of \u00a326,000 in Wales\u2014 it's around about 60 per cent of families are those. We're finding very few families are those who are on higher incomes. It's disproportionately towards those below the average income, and many of them amongst the most disadvantaged families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered. So, clearly, they're seeing the benefits of it.", "Mark Reckless AM: And what consideration have you given to integrating this Welsh Government offer with the UK Government\u00a0offer of tax-free childcare that's applicable across the UK?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Well, that offer, as you rightly say, is available across the UK and still is. The fact that it's more integrated within their scheme within England\u2014the tax offer is more integrated\u2014has caused them some problems in complexity and in the administration of this and the digital platforms that they've had. That offer is still available in Wales and it might well be that parents who opt in to that say, 'Well, we do want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours', but this 30 hours is there for every\u2014", "Mark Reckless AM: I wonder, Minister, whether what you're doing, in a very good way, to promote your project\u2014people will see that as the childcare offer and, at least in my experience, very few parents are aware of the tax-free childcare on a UK basis.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: You're right\u2014sorry. That's absolutely one of the lessons we've learnt from even this early stage of the early implementers, because there are elements of a childcare offer within the tax offer, within universal credit, within working tax credit. There are little bits of different ones and it does cause confusion. So, one of the lessons that we've learnt from the Talk Childcare communication strategy alongside this is the importance of communicating to parents and providers who the parents go to what is best for them to access, how they access it easily, and we'll learn more as these pilots roll by.", "Mark Reckless AM: So, as you go into the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs criteria\u2014you have a \u00a3100,000 cap, as well as the \u00a36,000 minimum wage cap, and you're getting HMRC to say whether people are eligible, which requires them to set up that account with HMRC\u2014will you assure this committee that you will make sure that parents who are doing that are aware of the UK tax-free childcare offer, and that their providers also are? Because we've been looking, say, at the \u00a37.50 extra per day, but, if someone's eligible for this offer, they should also be eligible for the UK tax-free childcare offer and have set up the account to do that. So, will you make sure that those parents know to pay their provider out of tax-free funds, rather than paying them the fully taxed amounts, which might otherwise happen?", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Yes, absolutely. And I think, if it's okay, Owain would like to add something as well.", "Owain Lloyd: Yes, just to say, as I understand how things currently work with the English offer and TFC, when a parent applies, that automatically happens in terms of, on the one hand, they're given a 'yes' or 'no' in terms of their eligibility for the 30-hours offer in England, but they will also be told in terms of the parental account that's set up under TFC. So, that is integrated in the offer, and we'll be looking to do the same in terms of the Welsh offer. But, obviously, what we're not looking at doing in terms of the 30-hours offer is the setting up of the parental account to make the payment; the payment currently is very much between local government and the provider directly, rather than the TFC model, where the parent pays the provider.", "Mark Reckless AM: Thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Okay. Well, we have come to\u2014well, we've run over, actually. So, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending? You are, of course, back with us on 16 May for Stage 1 of the Bill, so we will look forward to seeing you then. You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy, as is usual practice. But thank you again, all of you.", "Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Lovely. Thank you\u2014diolch yn fawr.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, item 3 then is papers to note. As Members can see, there are 11 papers to note. So, if Members are content, I'd suggest that we note all of them in a block, if that's okay. Yes, okay. Thank you. Item 4, then.

Oh no , but we  then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .", "Project Manager: Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,", "User Interface: Okay . All the same uh", "Project Manager: you have to pay point two Euros .", "Industrial Designer: So , all the buttons has to  have to be the same colour .", "Project Manager: Yes .", "Industrial Designer: But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?", "User Interface: Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what", "Industrial Designer: Recognisable , yeah .", "Project Manager: Yes .", "User Interface: Yeah . Mm , yeah .", "Project Manager: So", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ?", "User Interface: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Project Manager: So  Well  Now we have to change that , but that's okay .

So , now it's", "Industrial Designer: And the joystick away . And its buttons .", "Project Manager: Yeah . It is .

Well  What do you think of it ? Uh", "Industrial Designer: About the", "Project Manager: About the project .", "Marketing: Project .", "Industrial Designer: process . Went good . Uh  I think uh the creativity uh  was good enough .", "Industrial Designer: We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um  Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .", "Industrial Designer: So   yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh  no , uh o only the   the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found .  Nope .", "Project Manager: Okay . And you .", "User Interface: Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh  Yeah , it uh  It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um  Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor  and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion .", "Project Manager: Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions .", "Industrial Designer: No .", "Project Manager: So , it's good for the speed .", "User Interface: No .", "Industrial Designer: Yep .", "Project Manager: So , I think we're ready .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Good price .

I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . Anyway , it's  the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's  we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Project Manager: Okay .

Yeah . Okay , so w what you see here is  so  this is the outside of the remote , right ? If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: uh  everything else is kind of  Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: on pressing this button I  a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there .  So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . Right ? So that's the important point here ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: so these are the different options that we have . Okay . So the batteries , I'll start with the battery , right ?", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our  uh the cells , yeah ?", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Uh thes these are the kind  different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? So . And dynamos . Um", "Marketing: Does that mean like a wind-up one ?", "Industrial Designer: yeah , yeah .", "Marketing: A wind-up remote .", "Industrial Designer: So uh I don't know if  even if you want to consider this ,", "Industrial Designer: but these are the different things that the company makes , so th they'll they'll", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: since uh they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas uh cheaper , uh all these options .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: So  the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones .", "Marketing: You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching TV .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: And charging their remote ,", "Marketing: Yeah , and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just", "Project Manager: yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's a good option .", "User Interface: So what was what was this k ka", "Industrial Designer: The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: Uh yeah .", "Industrial Designer: But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm . For a remote , 'cause you  Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also  made by the company .", "Marketing: Yay .", "Industrial Designer: Environment friendly . Okay  um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective .", "Project Manager: Yeah  .", "Industrial Designer: There are different cases that can be provided . They can be  basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: and they can be curved with  on both the sides .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: These are the three options , right ? Um", "User Interface: Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , would it be flat on both the sides , would be curved from one side , or whatever", "User Interface: mm-hmm . Yeah , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Mm-hmm mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: uh there were different kind of supplements available , um like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ?", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Wo wo wood .", "Marketing: Did you say wool ?", "Project Manager: Wood , wood .", "Marketing: Wood . Oh right .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .  Not wool .", "Marketing: .", "Project Manager: A fluffy remote .", "Marketing: Yeah , you'll understand why when we get to my presenta  .", "Industrial Designer: Oh really ?  Okay . Um the", "Project Manager: Huh .", "Industrial Designer: so uh we can use even um  a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh  uh some space design equipment , so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface . If we choose this , we cannot use titanium . For for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah ?", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Uh okay , the interface options now . So  we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons .", "Industrial Designer: Ooh . Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh", "Marketing: Sony .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , something like that .", "Marketing: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: So , and they have  they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: The scroll plus push . So this is something that has been recently developed by the company , um  in the last decade , so not too recent . And LCDs , we can have LCDs . So these two are recent and and this is q quite old .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: The various electronic options are um uh  so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh  so there's there's a chip behind this one , right ? The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive , so we can put put in uh whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: or a regular or advanced . And uh the price goes up as we go down , obviously .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Um  okay , so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that LCDs can only come with the advanced chip .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Um the  we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels . Right ? Um  and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender , which is   did not explained what i what it was , but I'm guessing that uh   so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker . So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know , as soon as you press a button , it it mm uh give gives you feedback , one five or whatever . Yeah , on .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Um  and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: So , these are the different options that we have . Okay , so  th that's that's basically  now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um  uh you know , uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that , keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important , yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Excellent . Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board , so that if we need to", "User Interface: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , sure . Sure . Yeah .", "Project Manager: you can sit down , but just   we might need you to leap up .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Project Manager: What are you , PowerPoint , or", "User Interface: Um I have some PowerPoint , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Oh .", "Project Manager: Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ?", "User Interface: 'Kay .", "Project Manager: Some sort of radiation ?", "Marketing: No it's got its little camera in there ,  plug it in  .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , it should should do it . Yeah .", "Marketing: 'S a", "Project Manager: Right , interface concept .", "User Interface: Okay . Um to be honest actually , I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the  this talk um this time , I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk .", "Project Manager: That's fine .", "User Interface: So um yeah , this time um I might not have them on the slides but I  I can just mention them aw again .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Okay . So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which  uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data . So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Um um the method I  employed this time was  a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then  um  analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and  also um  whether their appearance was was pleasant . Um  and then um  this uh this um  this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: So some findings um  um . So in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn . Um  okay , and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found . Okay , some of them are here .", "User Interface: Um  well the picture is not very clear , but as you can see , there are actu oi , oh oh oh ,", "User Interface: sorry for that . 'S go back .", "Industrial Designer: That's nice one .", "User Interface: Ah , no , please . Okay , so yeah , they're quite big and have many many buttons . Actually  of the  of all these I personally p prefer this one , because it's it's the smallest and and with with least  uh with the smallest number of buttons as well . And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice .", "Marketing: Ugly .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "User Interface: Um okay . So let's carry on with this . Um  So uh um o other findings  um some new things um used , uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh .  Our own company has developed a new in user interface  uh wait , no this is not the one . Okay , there is a   we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows  i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display .", "Project Manager: It's  yeah .", "User Interface: Um s another new development is a scroll button , which was also th also already mentioned . And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed  a new um   uh programmable speech uh  mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess it's  it should be .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition , but it's  once once the mm  um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker , there can be a um pre-programmed answer , for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever .", "Project Manager: Uh-huh , hi  yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "User Interface: So  I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include .", "Industrial Designer: Uh sorry , uh can you go back for a second ? Um  uh are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ? Uh  oh yeah are th", "Project Manager: It's like the  like you said , no ? The scroll scroll wheel .", "Marketing: Yeah , you can't", "User Interface: No no , the scroll button is a different thing . I I have a picture if you   just a moment , I'll  I'll show you . I wasn't completely sure myself , but I think it's just like um  it's it's a wheel , it's like not separate buttons .", "Industrial Designer: Oh okay , the iPod thing , yeah .", "User Interface: Look , this one here .", "Marketing: Oh , it's like the iPod .", "User Interface: But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round ,", "Marketing: G yeah , no , you can .", "User Interface: it's like you press this or this or", "Industrial Designer: Uh it's the iPod uh kind of uh", "Marketing: It's like it's like where you  you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round", "Project Manager: Uh-huh .", "Industrial Designer: Alright , right . Okay , okay .", "Marketing: and it  yeah . It is", "Industrial Designer: So instead of going down you just spin  yeah , yeah .", "Marketing: You just go round", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: and it is a bit weird at first , but it's actually very like fast .", "Industrial Designer: Uh-huh .", "Marketing: I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Marketing: Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ , then it's a lot faster than the wheel ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Uh-huh .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: but you've got a lot less control over it .", "Industrial Designer: Right . So maybe I should include that here as well ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Mm .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: LCDs um plus spinning .", "User Interface: Uh", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: It  it has to be small , simple . Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard uh major buttons like on , off , um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen . Um and I I also thought uh  if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button , I thought it could be for for voice like , I dunno , it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something . There is  uh I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: So yeah , that's uh that's it .", "Project Manager: Excellent . Okay , straight to trends , and then we can discuss it all at once .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Marketing: Okay , I've put the copy of the presentation in um the", "Project Manager: The project documents .", "Marketing: yeah .", "Project Manager: Excellent . If you two could both do that as well , in case we need to refer to it .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Cool .", "Project Manager: Here it comes . Okay .", "Marketing: Fabulous . Okay , cool . Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Okay . Right . Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect .

Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Right . So mm uh so it", "Project Manager: That's over on the interface ,", "Industrial Designer: yeah ,", "Project Manager: if if you could put", "Industrial Designer: so probably voice recognition is is kind of important , right ?", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Um and an", "Project Manager: And maybe the LCD and spinning", "Industrial Designer: yeah . Okay , I I have a point about LCD ,", "Project Manager: so that means we need an advanced thing .", "Industrial Designer: I dunno if it is the right point to take it up . W uh LCDs are basically for feedback , right , to the user who's pressing buttons ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an LCD on the remote ?", "Marketing: Depends how fast your television runs , really , don't don't you think ? I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Marketing: and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the TV and then you wait , and then it comes , so i it actually takes quite a long time . And if you get the number in wrong , then it's a bit of a pain ,", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Marketing: so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Project Manager: It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen ,", "Marketing: You know ? Yeah .", "Project Manager: so if you're watching something", "Industrial Designer: That's true , yeah , that's also", "Marketing: And i it would be like  I mean if you could make it integrate with the TV then it could come up with new information about what's on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than", "Project Manager: Yeah . Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Marketing: But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that", "Industrial Designer: Mm right .", "Marketing: and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and ,", "Project Manager: And then you can flip it open .", "Industrial Designer: Okay .", "Marketing: yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So now we seem to have a consensus that LCDs are definitely the way to go because of style and", "Project Manager: Yeah , I think so .", "Marketing: Yeah , so that kind of decides your whole chip thing .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: You you agree ?

Okay , apparently , fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration .", "Marketing: Sorry , I discovered clip art .  Um so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture .

{"meeting_id": "m_val_14", "domain": "committee", "meeting_transcripts": ["Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies, although Dawn Bowden is running late. I'll take this opportunity to welcome Dawn formally to the committee but also to place on record our thanks to John Griffiths for his service to the committee. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is\u00a0a scrutiny session with a focus on higher and further education. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, Eluned Morgan, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, and Huw Morris, who is the group director of skills, higher education and lifelong learning. Thank you all for your attendance this morning. If you're okay with it, we'll go straight into questions. The first questions are from Suzy Davies.", "Suzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. If we can just start with teacher training and teacher training for secondary school teachers in particular, obviously there's been what looks like a trend in recent years in filling the places for secondary school training. Obviously, this is at Welsh teacher training centres. Do you think there's still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places, or is there a trend where things are getting better?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Suzy. I think, for this year's intake, although we're in touch with our providers, we're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year's intake for a couple of months. But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets. So, there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs. So, what we're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class, so that, actually, Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher. You'll be aware that we've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year. We have looked at financial incentives. It's not the whole answer, I think, to these issues, but it's part of a mixture of things that we need to do. You'll be aware that, for priority subjects, with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications, those financial incentives are now \u00a320,000 a year. We're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees, e-mailing them, sending them materials to ask them to consider (1) becoming a teacher, and (2) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales. We are now part of a full national programme of ITE\u00a0recruitment, giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher. So, there's a whole package of things we need to do. In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff, and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next.", "Suzy Davies AM: Thank you for that answer. I can see there's a lot of activity, but what exactly is it responding to? Presumably, some research has been done about why people don't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers. I can't believe it's just about ITE, although this is very valuable, what you're talking about. Is there something that's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching isn't a profession they want\u00a0to go into? Is that something that's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well?", "Kirsty Williams AM: No. I think what you will find is that this isn't a uniquely Welsh issue. I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border, which proves to me that money isn't necessarily the entire answer, because, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, they're not able to do that in England either. So, that proves to me\u2014what the research does show\u2014that it's not money alone that will get people onto these courses. Interestingly, I don't even think it's a UK problem. Recently, as you'll be aware via my written statement, I attended the Atlantic Rim\u00a0Collaboratory, which is a system-to-system conference. If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world, the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention. In the USA, they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers. So, in the Californian system, significant teacher shortages, and in Oregon, Washington. I met with New York state\u2014significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state, and in Finland, Australia. So, this is a common issue across the globe, really. That's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner\u2014it's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off. One of the things that we have got strong performance in, and I think this is perhaps something that we're trying to follow up on, are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status\u2014so, those are people who are training on the job. Those remain strong. There's high demand for those places, so much so that we've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year, which says to me that\u2014there's definitely a place for the traditional, 'Take a year off, do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'\u2014actually, that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching, which is why, of course, from next year, we will have our unique part-time PGCE\u00a0route into qualification. So, that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities, so they can earn while they learn, or maybe they've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course. I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools. So, there's no one thing, I think, that we can do that will solve this issue. But it is an international issue, I agree with that.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, that's what I was after finding out, and, actually, what you've just said about the part-time PGCE\u00a0is pretty interesting as well, because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching, that's got to help, hasn't it?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Can I just agree with you? I think that is really, really important\u2014that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce. I think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really, really valuable. I was up in the Deeside\u00a0Sixth just last week, talking to the A-level chemistry teacher. She had been a teacher for a while, she'd gone into industry, worked in industry, and now had come back into teaching. She said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue. I'm very keen to increase the diversity in our teaching workforce and I'm very keen in looking at career changers, who perhaps have different life experience and work experience, coming into our teaching profession.", "Suzy Davies AM: Thank you for that. Part of that diversity, of course\u2014it would be great if you had more people interested in qualifying to teach through the medium of Welsh. Great aspirations; the trend's going the other way. No-one can solve this in 280 characters, I get that, but can you give us some indication about why you think this is proving still such an unattractive option when it's clear that there's a policy for this country to improve the number of Welsh speakers? You'd have thought there'd be a pretty good carrot for this.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Sure. Again, data for recruitment for the 2018-19 cohort is not yet available and we are, as I said, keeping in touch with our ITE\u00a0centres to keep a close eye on them. I think an important thing to recognise is that there is a difference between the number of people who are on courses where there is a specific designation that enables them to teach through the medium of Welsh and those people who have linguistic ability and Welsh ability but don't necessarily do a course that allows them. So, there is a difference. We do think that, for the 2016-17 cohort, there were an additional 130 qualifiers\u00a0that, actually, were fluent in Welsh and who could have gone on to teach in Welsh-medium schools, didn't necessarily do a course that gave them that designation. But, clearly, we've got three academic years now to get to the targets that we've set ourselves. The evaluation of Welsh-medium provision in ITE reported at the end of last month, and the Minister and officials are busy working now to implement the recommendations of the report that was published, I think, on 28 September, to be able to move this agenda forward. Again, we've got new incentives, this year, both for people starting their course and then for teachers who complete their QTS after a year. So, we've added in new financial incentives this year to try and address some of those issues. But, clearly, these are ambitious targets and we will need to have a step change over the next three years if we're to meet them.", "Suzy Davies AM: Thank you for that, Cabinet Secretary. Thank you for that answer. We're now talking about cohorts of students coming into\u00a0PGCE and teaching degrees. If they're from Wales, they will have had Welsh as part of their education from day one, and we'll accept there are varying\u00a0qualities in different parts of Wales, different attitudes towards it as well. But there isn't a single a person now who's been through Welsh education who can say they have no Welsh at all, unless they've moved into the system\u00a0from, say, England very, very recently. What is being done within the teaching qualifications, including the degrees, to ensure that, at least in Welsh universities, those nascent Welsh language skills are at least kept alive, even though we're not talking necessarily about being at a level where people can teach through the medium? It's\u00a0the age-old question: once the school gate closes, is that the end of their Welsh use? So, is there something\u2014it won't be Donaldson, but in the teacher training qualifications\u2014that is keeping this going and, hopefully, increasing the usability of the Welsh skills they have?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, in terms of how we can encourage children who have got Welsh skills as a result of their education up to 16, how they can\u00a0continue to use those skills and, potentially, use them in the workplace, I'm sure Eluned will want to talk about\u00a0some of the work, for instance, in other, non-teaching sectors. But, with regard to ITE, you'll be aware that, in the evaluation report, as I said, that was published, the report comes forward with two options in how we could develop an intervention programme to support Welsh language\u00a0skills\u00a0amongst all primary and secondary ITE\u00a0entrants. So, what we'll be doing now as a result of that report is that we'll be working very closely with our ITE\u00a0centres\u00a0to develop and agree upon minimum provision that constitutes those skill levels within ITE\u00a0provision for all teachers.", "Suzy Davies AM: Thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Llyr.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: You have your targets for 2021, in terms of numbers of teachers coming through the system, which is positive, although, clearly, the report or the review itself said that, actually, we need to double the numbers, really. But it's not just the trends that are going down; it's a cataclysmic drop, really. We've lost 24 per cent in the number of people over the last four or five years who are going into teacher training to study subjects that they could teach through the medium of Welsh. So, it's a huge turnaround that we're looking for, and I'm not getting the feeling that the level of ambition and the answers that you're giving here this morning\u00a0reflect the level of action that's\u00a0needed, really.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, first of all, as I tried to illustrate to Suzy, the figures on their\u00a0own\u00a0tell one story, but there are additional people in the system with an ability to speak Welsh and to be able to use\u2014", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: I think it's\u00a040 per cent\u00a0of those who are currently in the system who don't\u2014", "Kirsty Williams AM: \u2014the language and skills. And if we look at qualifiers of ITE courses in Wales by degree type, actually, we see a different trend\u2014we see numbers going up. So, there are statistics and there are statistics. Depending on which ones you look at, it's quite a complex picture. And that's why we had the evaluation report. We understand and we know and acknowledge that there is more work to be done. That's why we have got the evaluation of provision in ITE\u00a0and that's why we'll be taking that ambition\u00a0forward. We know what we need to do. As I said, we're not sitting back and hoping\u00a0that something miraculous will change things. We are pulling levers and putting in place plans to improve that situation.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you for that. Clearly, there are statistics\u00a0and there are statistics, so could you just explain to us which statistics you've used for your targets for growth over the next three years?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, that comes as a result of the work done for the 2050\u2014", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Upon which baseline are you basing the increases that you're projecting?", "Kirsty Williams AM: We're using the baseline of 2012-13. There has been a decline since then.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: That's the one I was using when I said '24 per cent reduction'.", "Kirsty Williams AM: There has been a decline in those numbers. That's why, as I said, we're doing the work that we need to do to reverse that decline. In using those numbers, we also know that there are additional people in the system who are not captured in those figures and who do have the linguistic ability to use their language positively in school settings. So, what I'm saying is that that doesn't tell us the whole story, but I will be the first to admit that there is a significant job of work with our ITE providers to ensure that we will have the skilled professionals that we need to deliver on our ambitions, and I'm not hiding from that.", "Eluned Morgan AM: Also, I just think it's worth saying that a lot of this is about building the confidence of those people who actually can speak Welsh, who are not teaching through the medium of Welsh, and to give them that support. First of all, we need to identify who these people are, so there is a job of work being undertaken now in terms of registration in particular\u2014when people register, let's just make sure that we collect that kind of data.", "Kirsty Williams AM: We don't even do that consistently at the moment. One of the recommendations of the report is that there is no consistent approach to understanding this baseline data and there's no consistent competency test that people start at the beginning of their course, so we need a national approach rather than leaving it to individual institutions.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Have we missed any tricks, potentially, in terms of the reforms to accrediting ITE, for example, in terms of, maybe, strengthening aspects around the Welsh language and provision in that respect?", "Kirsty Williams AM: No, I don't believe so. The accreditation process, which is independent of the Government\u2014the accreditation process demands of our ITE\u00a0providers that their provision will be able to meet the goals of our curriculum. Our curriculum is very clear about the equality of the language and the ability of our children, through all stages of their education journey, to be able to be bilingual children.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: So, that requirement, as far you're concerned, is there.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Yes, okay. Diolch\u2014thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Before I turn to Hefin, can I just clarify\u2014? In answer to Suzy Davies, you said that 65 per cent of the places in Welsh training centres\u00a0had been filled. Is that 65 per cent of the priority places?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Priority places.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you very much.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Sixty-five per cent of the priority courses are being met.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Lovely, thank you for clarifying that. Hefin.", "Hefin David AM: The decision by the Education\u00a0Workforce Council\u00a0not to accredit the University of South Wales with the ability to deliver teacher training\u2014what are your views and concerns about that?", "Kirsty Williams AM: The process is independent of Government, and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on that, especially as I understand that there is an appeals process that may be being undertaken. What I would say is that from the very outset of our ITE\u00a0reforms we have made it very clear that I expect very high standards in our ITE\u00a0system, but the process is independent of this Government. I have confidence in the people who have been appointed by the EWC\u00a0to undertake that process, but it is independent of me, and it's not appropriate for me to comment on that further.", "Hefin David AM: I fully understand that and the need for distance for the EWC, but there'll be an impact on students and staff. Students, first of all: are you concerned that the reduction in providers might have an impact on students, and those students going through the second year at USW? Would you have concerns about that issue?", "Kirsty Williams AM: In terms of the overall numbers, we will be looking to commission from those institutions that have been accredited the number of training places that our planning tool says that we need. So, in terms of an overall number of places, we will commission from those accredited units. Clearly, there will be a responsibility upon the University of South Wales to ensure that those students already in the system are able to complete their studies and their course, with the appropriate level of support and tuition to enable them to achieve their career aspirations and to graduate from that programme.", "Hefin David AM: And what about the uncertainty for staff, or would you say that's an issue for the university itself?", "Kirsty Williams AM: These are autonomous bodies. They have to act accordingly, in compliance with any employment law or any statutory responsibilities that they would have as an employer. That's not a matter for me; that is a matter for the institution that is an autonomous body.", "Hefin David AM: But I would be surprised if you weren't keeping an eye on this, given that it has been a key provider. Are you aware of when the appeal decision will be known?", "Kirsty Williams AM: My understanding is that the appeals process is ongoing, and next month, perhaps. But as I said, this is a process that is independent of Government\u2014", "Hefin David AM: But it will have an impact for what you do.", "Kirsty Williams AM: It will potentially change the nature of the people from whom we commission places, but as I said, I do not have any concerns that we will not be in a position to commission the appropriate number of training places that we will need as a result of our planning.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Suzy on this\u2014mindful of what the Minister said about it being an independent decision.", "Suzy Davies AM: It's not directly about USW; it's about the geographic spread of provision. I wonder if you could just give us a snapshot of what that looks like, and whether you think\u2014certainly for PGCE or postgrad courses, anyway\u2014that if they're not accessible geographically and we've got students who already have three years' worth of debt, they're not going to be looking to, necessarily, live away from home for a fourth year, and may want to study nearer home. Has there been any research done on the access to these postgrad\u00a0courses, about where people are coming from and whether that's had an impact on the fact that some of these places haven't been filled?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Currently, with our current providers, there is a significant geographical spread. There are centres here in the south-east, there are centres\u00a0in the south-west, in mid Wales, and in north Wales. Obviously, accessibility is an issue for us. We do think that, for some students, accessibility is an issue, and of course that's why we are responding with our part-time PGCE\u00a0route, which actually will be location neutral, because you will be able to study that as a distance learner, and so you will be able to remain in your community and undertake that course. So, that's part of the attractiveness, I believe, of offering that to people. So, if geographical disadvantage is stopping somebody from pursuing a career aspiration to qualify as a teacher, our new part-time PGCE, as I said, will allow them to do that.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay. Thanks, Chair.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We're going to move on now to talk about reform and reconfiguration of the post-16 education sector. Janet Finch-Saunders.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Good morning. There are some encouraging provisional signs regarding the demand for part-time undergraduate study for the first year of Diamond, but the \u00a312.5 million reduction\u00a0Higher Education Funding Council for Wales\u00a0is having to make this academic year has potentially placed the funding for part-time provision under pressure. Is there a danger that, without maintaining and growing this funding, Welsh Government will undermine the Diamond reforms and increase the cost of part-time courses?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Let's be absolutely clear what this Government has done for part-time students. We are unique, Janet: unique in the UK and, I believe, unique in Europe, in the parity of the support that is available for full-time and part-time students. So, Welsh part-timers have something that they do not get if they are in England or if they're in Scotland. It's too early to have definitive figures for the impact of Diamond on the number of people who are undertaking part-time study. I don't want to get into trouble by not having that verified data, and I know Members get testy with me for anecdotal evidence, but I can tell you this: there is one provider that is reporting at this moment a 40 per cent increase in the number of students that are registered to start part-time study with them this year, as compared to last year, and that reflects really, really well, compared to the onward downward trend that we see across the border for part-time. What this means, for us as a nation, is that people are able to take this opportunity to upskill themselves and to be able to develop their qualifications and to be able to move themselves up career ladders, and I think that's such an important economic factor for us. So, rather than feeling doom and gloom about the prospects for the part-time sector, the early indications, at least, show that the Diamond reforms are leading to an increase in demand and, more importantly, an increase in uptake\u2014students taking advantage of that system to go away and study.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Is the Welsh Government able to reassure the committee that its ambitions for the post-compulsory education and training\u00a0reforms are still in line with the original Hazelkorn recommendations, and go beyond the Labour manifesto commitment of simply replacing HEFCW with a new funding body for HE and FE?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, you will be aware, Janet, that the agreement between myself and the First Minister that brought me into the Government and the Government's programme state very clearly about our desire to pursue the recommendations of the Hazelkorn report. I hope, by the end of this week, we will have published the responses to the technical consultation, and we will continue to move forward. And I would argue, certainly, that the reforms that we are intending to implement do go beyond just simply a body that replaces HEFCW and joins in FE. It's a much wider remit to the potential new commission. And, as I said, I believe we've had in the region of about 450 responses to the technical consultation and I'm pleased to say that there remains a consensus\u2014we will always have some arguments about the details\u2014but there remains a consensus on the direction of travel that we are pursuing. A summary of the consultation responses will be available to Members and will be published by the end of the week.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. Is the Welsh Government still committed to introducing the PCET Bill before the end of the fifth Assembly, and are you confident this will happen?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, I'm absolutely determined that we will get the PCET legislation on the floor. It's a substantial piece of work, as you've just alluded to. This goes just beyond abolishing a single body. So, it is a substantial piece of work, but I believe that we are on track to be able to do that by the end of this term. But it's a big piece of work.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Llyr, on this.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Can I just pick up on that? I mean, it is going to be a big job, and, clearly, there's a strong focus on creating the commission and putting the structures in place, but, of course, one of the drivers is that we want to effect a cultural change in the way that people perceive post-16 education. This thing about parity of esteem and all that kind of agenda. And a key part of this process, therefore, is the vision that people are waiting for. When are we going to see this coming forward? Because I think we're putting structures in place, so there's a big discussion about the technical stuff, but I feel there's a bit of a vacuum\u00a0in terms of the vision.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, I would disagree with you, Llyr, because\u2014", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Right, okay. Well, maybe you should have come to the cross-party group on further education last night.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, I would disagree with you because, of course, the technical consultation has followed what we had last year, which was a consultation on the vision, on what we needed to do to bring the sector together beyond just HE and FE, to the inclusion of sixth forms; work-based learning providers; apprenticeships; and bringing all of that together under one body. I believe that that gives us an opportunity to have better strategic planning; to help us prevent duplication; to help us bridge gaps that are not available for learners at the moment. It will, hopefully\u2014. My vision is that it will promote collaboration between institutions rather than simply having the market-based process that we see in other places where there's competition rather than collaboration. I want to see it strengthen links between schools, FE and HE, strengthen links between schools and employers and business, to make sure that we've got better information and advice services so that young people know what their pathways are and can make really informed choices about what's best for them, to help them make them. So, I think: we've done the vision, we're now doing the technical consultation, that will be published by the end of the week, and we'll move forward with our overarching vision that Hazelkorn elaborated and that we are now taking forward.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: So, you would be very concerned if FE institutions were saying that we really need to see the vision, that that's the next step, that we really need to understand the vision.", "Kirsty Williams AM: But, I've met\u2014. As I said, I was with one of our excellent FE leaders\u00a0just at the end of last week; it wasn't raised with me then. I do understand that there are concerns from the FE sector about will the vision be realised. I think there's a shared understanding of the vision, but I understand and I\u00a0do see some nervousness about, actually, in the end, will this just be HEFCW by another name, and, the opportunity for FE, will this be realised in this new body? We need to keep ensuring that, as we go forward and develop the policy, and as we develop, eventually, the legislation, that that parity of esteem and that true equality across all parts of the sector is realised.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you very much. Our next questions are from Michelle Brown.", "Michelle Brown AM: Good morning, Cabinet Secretary; good morning, Minister. Your paper to the committee says that there's a need for more analysis and research into the outcomes for learners from different backgrounds. At the same time, Welsh universities have declared \u00a3104 million towards equality and opportunity activity for 2018. If you don't have the analysis, how can you be sure that the investment that's being made by the Welsh universities is actually going to have a positive outcome in the right places and lead to better outcomes for underrepresented groups?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. Well, of course, that would be one of the duties of the new commission set up as a result of our\u00a0post-compulsory education and training reforms that I would anticipate. The universities are required, under the\u00a0Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015, to produce fee and access statements, and the \u00a3104 million that they have to take off their fees to be able to promote this work\u2014those fee and access plans have to be signed off by the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales as being robust and truly promoting equality of opportunity. They're also there to promote access and the opportunities for people to aspire to higher education. We are looking at\u2014.\u00a0It's quite early days, still, for that new regulatory regime to come through, so we ask HEFCW, when I meet with HEFCW, about the adequacy of those plans. Equity is an important part of my approach to higher education. That's why we're introducing the Diamond reforms\u2014so that those from the poorest backgrounds can be adequately financially supported and are not put off from going to a university. And we're also looking\u2014. I would envisage under PCET a better mechanism of tracking destinations for learners. So, for instance, in the FE sector, we're introducing new joint monitoring for outcomes for sixth-form learners and FE learners, because we've never tracked them in the same way. So, we're introducing that now so that we can see the destinations for those two sectors, but the PCET\u00a0reforms give us an opportunity to do that right across the board. Huw, is there anything else I need to add?", "Huw Morris: Well, I'd just reinforce the point the Cabinet Secretary made about the fee and access plans being the vehicle through which\u00a0we get universities to specify what they're going to do, and the funding council tracks that. To make sure that we're doing that in a full and appropriate manner, periodically, we ask for that system to be reviewed. I think it was in 2017 that the\u00a0Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods\u2014the research arm of Cardiff University\u2014reviewed the system and looked at how widening access was being promoted by different institutions and whether that was working in all parts of Wales. The report from that group was considered by one of the sub-committees in HEFCW\u00a0and they are revising the process as a consequence. So, I think we can be confident that there are ambitious targets that are monitored, and, periodically, the system as a whole is reviewed.", "Michelle Brown AM: Can you tell us what sort of research and data the universities are basing those access plans on? I assume they'll all have slightly different methods\u2014I appreciate that\u2014but can you give us any idea of how they actually formulate these access plans?", "Huw Morris: So, there are data collected across the UK by a body called the Higher Education Statistics Agency. They produce detailed breakdowns, along with UCAS, of where applicants come from, which institutions did they study at, what courses, what their particular characteristics are, including their socioeconomic status, and that data is then analysed at a UK level and in Wales, through HEFCW\u00a0and its agents, to track what's happening at different institutions at different stages, not just in terms of who's applying and who gets access, but who progresses and what happens to people once they've graduated.", "Michelle Brown AM: So, there is already data there. I'm just wondering how that data that's already there differs from the research and analysis that you were talking about in your paper. They must be different, then. What specific analysis and research were you referring to in your paper?", "Kirsty Williams AM: We use the HESA\u2014. It is HESA, isn't it?", "Huw Morris: Yes.", "Kirsty Williams AM: That's shorthand\u2014the HESA data, and institutions use that. We also then use WISERD and other organisations to supplement that piece of work. I think there is a challenge to some of this going forward. So, the Office for Students in England now is having some discussions about access to HESA data. This is a source of real concern to me, that Welsh institutions may not be able to have the ready access to that data because of changes the OfS may be making. So, we supplement where we think that there's value to be added in additional breakdowns, or in additional slicing of data and understanding of what is motivating people to come forward.", "Huw Morris: And to give you a specific example of that as it applies in north Wales\u2014. So, take a university like Wrexham Glynd\u0175r University; they have quite a large intake of mature students. The data that's collected and analysed at a UK level tends to look at people who are going into university at a young age, not a mature profile. So, some of the analysis that we do in Wales\u2014indeed, the deliberations of the sub-committee that I spoke about earlier\u2014is about how do we make sure that those differences in Wales are reflected in the data and reflected in the targets that are set.", "Michelle Brown AM: Okay.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The next questions are from Hefin David.", "Hefin David AM: Cabinet Secretary, are you in favour of more university mergers?", "Kirsty Williams AM: I wouldn't use the word 'agnostic', but what I'm in favour of is a healthy, strong and sustainable HE sector. If individual institutions wish to collaborate or, indeed, go further to a formal merger then, obviously, that is a matter for them. We're not pursuing or urging a policy of mergers, but, if individual institutions feel that is of benefit to them and their students, obviously, we would have an interest in that and making sure that they were robust plans, but that's a matter for individual institutions.", "Hefin David AM: But HEFCW are pushing it.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, again, what HEFCW are interested in is a sustainable HE sector that is strong but, as I said, I do not have a burning desire or a set policy to try and pursue mergers.", "Hefin David AM: Okay. That's a little bit of a contrast with your predecessors, then.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, that's a matter for them.", "Hefin David AM: Okay. The reason I say it is because I was kind of on the inside when Cardiff Metropolitan University was under pressure from the then Minister to merge with the University of Glamorgan and Newport. It was a very difficult time for staff and, indeed, for students. You had the University and College Union and the Minister pushing it; the vice-chancellor of Cardiff Met at the time very much against it. So, do you think that it's really\u2014? You're agnostic, but do you think perhaps it's not worth the disruption that can occur to staff and students?", "Kirsty Williams AM: As I said, Hefin, I have no formal policy for reconfiguration or mergers. That's not to say I don't believe in collaboration between institutions. Going back to the issue of ITE, a very interesting programme came forward from Cardiff Met and Cardiff University for their ITE provision. So, I'm all for universities and institutions working together, but there's no formal policy. These are autonomous institutions. If they see that there is an advantage\u2014I would hope for the student first, and, if we put the student at the front of this process, then we would obviously have an interest in that and making sure that that was the right thing to do. But, certainly, there is no pressure from us as a Government to pursue an agenda of mergers.", "Hefin David AM: Just to be clear, then, that's likely to be a policy for the foreseeable future as well; you're not going to change that view.", "Kirsty Williams AM: I have no intentions at this stage, but 'Events, dear boy'. [Laughter.] You know, sometimes\u00a0there may be a situation that I cannot foresee at this moment that would necessitate, for the benefit of students, the benefit of Wales, a merger. So, never say never, but, at this point in time, I do not foresee us changing that policy.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Julie on this.", "Julie Morgan AM: Yes, just looking back at that time, which I remember very vividly\u2014", "Hefin David AM: So do I.", "Julie Morgan AM: I had many meetings with Cardiff Met. Do you feel there has been any disadvantage to Cardiff Met because that merger didn't go ahead?", "Kirsty Williams AM: I, personally, am not aware\u00a0of any disadvantage to Cardiff Met, but I would recognise\u2014I would absolutely\u00a0recognise\u2014for staff and students caught up in those deliberations and those issues, then that would have had a personal impact on them. In terms of the institution going forward, I'm not aware that they are currently struggling with any disadvantage from that discussion. And, as I said, I'm really heartened\u00a0by some of the really interesting collaborative work that Cardiff Met are interested\u00a0in doing, and new partnerships and new collaborations between institutions, whether that be Cardiff Uni\u00a0or local colleges, and I think that's to be welcomed.", "Julie Morgan AM: So, following on from what Hefin said, was it worth all the fuss?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, look, as it's turned out, we have a strong institution\u00a0in Cardiff Met, and I think, rather than looking at the past, we need to look at the future. But, of course, there was some reconfiguration and we need to understand any lessons that arose out of reconfiguration, and HEFCW are currently doing\u00a0some work, actually, to look at reconfiguration, the experience of\u00a0reconfiguration that did happen, and were benefits realised\u00a0and what are the lessons that can be learned from that process. So, they are doing a piece of work to reflect, and that will, perhaps, help inform us as\u00a0we go forward.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, Hefin.", "Hefin David AM: I'd just say\u2014Julie Morgan was one of our heroes at the time, I've got to say.", "Eluned Morgan AM: She always is.", "Hefin David AM: And still is. If I turn that on its head and have a look at University of South Wales, one of the concerns I'm getting from former colleagues and staff is that the Newport aspect\u2014because it was\u00a0a merger between Newport and the University of Glamorgan\u2014has been somewhat denuded by the merger, and the amount of activity in the new Newport campus and elsewhere in Newport has been reduced by the merger. Are you aware of those concerns that staff may have?", "Kirsty Williams AM: As I\u00a0said, it's not for me to second-guess the judgment of previous Ministers who pursued\u2014", "Hefin David AM: But it's happening\u00a0now, I mean.", "Kirsty Williams AM: \u2014a particular policy agenda. With regard to Newport, we are aware of concerns. Obviously, one campus closed completely, and there are concerns about the level of activity at the new campus. And we continue to discuss with the University of South Wales and the local FE college what offer is available to\u00a0the local population, but also the wider contribution that that institution can make to the rest of Wales, and we continue to have conversations with both\u00a0the college and the university about utilisation\u00a0of the facilities in Newport and opportunities that could be made available in Newport.", "Hefin David AM: That's interesting, because\u00a0that's the first time I've heard it confirmed from the Government that those concerns that have been raised by former staff and colleagues in Newport are actually echoed\u00a0by yourself, then.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, as I said, we're aware of them. We take our time to listen to people. When people raise issues with us, we take them seriously. Clearly, going back to the point that I believe Suzy made about geographical coverage, we want to make sure that FE and HE opportunities are available for people throughout Wales, and\u00a0we continue to work with providers\u00a0in that area to explore\u00a0what can be done to enhance the opportunities.", "Hefin David AM: And, from a financial point of view, they had \u00a325 million for the merger. Are you satisfied that's value for money, and, at this point in the 10-year plan, that things are going as they should, with incomes being squeezed across the sector?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. I mean, it's difficult, isn't it, to second-guess what would have happened, what might have happened, if the merger hadn't gone ahead, around the financial stability and sustainability of an institution. How do you prove that, if that hadn't happened, something worse or something better\u00a0might have happened? It's difficult to do that and to second-guess those judgments, but, as I've said, what I am interested in\u2014. And I can't change that decision that was made by a previous Minister\u2014it wasn't my decision\u2014but what I can do is to ensure that any lessons learnt, any evaluation of that particular set of circumstances, can be looked at and can help inform future policy, which is why HEFCW is doing the piece of work. When that's published, you and I will be in a better position to understand whether the aspirations of that particular merger were realised, not realised, and if we were in that situation again, could we do it better next time?", "Hefin David AM: Okay, so you'll reflect on that later. At this point in time, you don't have any concerns about the long-term sustainability of the University of South Wales.", "Kirsty Williams AM: No, not at this point.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Janet.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. The Welsh Government's draft outline budget for 2019 states that it will continue to provide \u00a320 million to further and higher education in 2019-20. Can you outline how this will be allocated between HE and FE and if conditions will be attached to the funding?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Janet, you will have to wait until the end of the month, when the detailed, main expenditure group by main expenditure group lines of the budget are published, otherwise I will be stealing the finance Minister's thunder. There is a process by which the Welsh Government's budget is dealt with, and those details will emerge later on this month.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you.", "Kirsty Williams AM: But can I just say on conditions\u2014? You will be aware that there are conditions attached to Government spend, both in the FE sector and in the HE sector. Those budgets will be subject to those existing arrangements; so, for instance, in the HE sector, the remit letter to HEFCW.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We're\u2014", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Can I just pick up on funding, generally? Sorry. Because, we did talk about HEFCW\u00a0and part-time funding earlier, and I'm not sure that we addressed the issue of this \u00a312.5 million cut in a specific budget line from HEFCW, because what they've done, if I understand correctly, is that they've put four priorities into one budget line, which includes part-time teaching, and cut that budget line by \u00a312.5 million. Are you not concerned that that'll have an impact on part-time teaching, given that it's such a success story that you're proud of?", "Kirsty Williams AM: HEFCW\u00a0have to take cognisance\u00a0of the remit letter, but then, ultimately, they are free to allocate resources as they see fit. What will drive part-time provision is the students taking it up, and universities responding to that desire and that need within their institutions. So, at this moment, I don't have any concerns.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We're going to move on now to look at the parity of esteem between academic and vocational post-16 education. The first question is from Michelle.", "Michelle Brown AM: Thank you, Chair. Welsh Government wants to achieve parity of esteem between academic and vocational education, and I think that's a very laudable aim. Higher apprenticeships are a key part of this, but Estyn's recent inspection found that only four providers from 17 were achieving good outcomes for learners. What action do you propose to take about this, to make sure that those learners have much better outcomes across the board?", "Eluned Morgan AM: First of all, just to make it clear that that is very much our intention. I think we have got work to do to make sure that we do reach that parity of esteem, but let's be clear that, in relation to these higher level apprenticeships, we were concerned that, actually, we weren't doing as well, perhaps, as we should be, which is why we commissioned Estyn to look at this specifically, and what it was that we were doing well, and what we needed to improve on. One of the things that we found is that we are doing very well in relation to foundation courses in terms of attainment\u2014we've got 83 per cent attainment levels\u2014but if you look at that at higher level apprenticeships, then we've got 77 per cent, so what is going wrong there? But, also, it's worth underlining the fact that, actually, we're still miles ahead of England, who are only reaching levels of about 61 per cent. So, we're already doing much better than England, but we're ambitious, and we want to make sure that if we are serious about this parity of esteem, how do we get there if we're not offering the kind of quality that we'd like to see in those higher level apprenticeships? So, some of the recommendations in that report, we'll be taking up. We want to increase the number of new employers\u00a0and mentors within the system. I think we're also very keen to make sure that people don't repeat learning that they've already done. That's a danger and it takes up too much time. So, there are lots of these recommendations that now we'll set in motion, and I think the important thing for us then is to understand that, in relation to who's doing well and who's not doing well in the FE sector, the bulk of where that finance goes is actually doing quite well. It's pushing some of the private sector providers where we need to actually make sure that the quality is where we want it to be, and is, very importantly, matching the needs of employers. So, we've constantly got to be looking at the courses: are they responding to the needs of the market and what employers are looking for? And that means revising the offer sometimes in terms of the courses.", "Michelle Brown AM: Where are the difficulties arising\u2014? You refer to difficulties arising with the private providers. What are those difficulties?", "Eluned Morgan AM: Well, some of it is about, perhaps, not giving the kind of guidance that we'd like them to give in-house. So, they're perhaps not doing the kind of on-the-job work that we'd like them to do. So, I think it's making sure that, when they're in the workplace, they are still being pushed to attain those levels. But I think it's clear that what we need to do is to also listen to what the advisory board that we've set up in relation to apprenticeships is also asking us, and we've got the Confederation of British Industry advising us on that as well.", "Michelle Brown AM: Do you have a service level agreement with the private providers?", "Eluned Morgan AM: Yes. I mean, the whole thing is under a tender procedure, obviously, and we will be revising that soon. There'll be a new apprenticeship procurement process that we'll be undergoing and starting to look at that process next year. So, there's an opportunity there for us to drive change in the system.", "Michelle Brown AM: Would you be willing to share the targets under the SLA with the committee?", "Eluned Morgan AM: Well, I think the\u2014. I can't see that there'd be a problem with that, so I'm sure we could do that, but I think the way to make people move, quite often, is through making sure that you put the finances where they need to be, and then they're likely to shift. And, so, I think, in responding to this Estyn report, we can then build that into the next framework.", "Michelle Brown AM: Okay, thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Julie.", "Julie Morgan AM: Yes, thank you. Right, I wanted to ask about the investment. If we're going to get parity of esteem, we've got to, probably, get more investment in. Could you say why there isn't more investment in degree, and there doesn't seem to be any investment in Master's-level apprenticeships at universities?", "Eluned Morgan AM: Well, I think we've got to be careful that what happens is that the state doesn't pick up what, currently, people are prepared to pay for themselves, and, so, we've got to just make sure that that balance is right. So, what's happened in England, for example, is lots of people who were previously sitting Master of business administration courses, for example, are now switching into apprenticeship programmes. So, the system\u2014it means that, previously, they were prepared to pay and now the state is paying or the employer's playing it in a slightly different way. So, I think we've got to just be aware about how\u2014making sure that we don't get employers passing that responsibility that, actually, they have to upskill and to uptrain\u00a0their workers and pass it back on to the state, whereas, actually, they need to step up as well as employers.", "Julie Morgan AM: So, how are you going to judge that? How are you going to tell when, maybe, you should start putting some money in?", "Eluned Morgan AM: Well, what we are doing is we're putting money into areas where we know there are skills shortages. So, we're focusing where we want those apprenticeships\u2014and particularly at the higher level\u2014to be. So, for example, we're looking at ICT; we're looking at construction. There are\u00a0areas where we definitely need to be focusing our attention. So, that's where we'll be prioritising our funding, and that's what we're doing already.", "Kirsty Williams AM: And that's for degree-level apprenticeships, not Master's. Just degree-level apprenticeships.", "Julie Morgan AM: Right, thank you. And then, in terms of getting data, could you clarify the progress on developing outcome and destination data for higher apprenticeships? Your plan seems to suggest that\u00a0data won't be available until 2020-21, at the end of the programme.", "Eluned Morgan AM: And that's because we're only just starting on this, and it takes a long time for people to complete an apprenticeship. So, we won't have anybody going from the higher level apprenticeship into a destination until around 2021, so there's no point in measuring that until that point.", "Julie Morgan AM: Right. And then, can you tell us when you'll publish Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol's new operational plan to develop post-16 Welsh-medium provision, which was presented during July, and clarify if the plan requires additional funding?", "Eluned Morgan AM: So, there is a report that was published in July, and we are waiting for the operational actions from that report to be published, probably within the next month. In terms of the implementation of that programme, some of that journey has already begun, so they're not waiting for the report to\u2014. We're not waiting for the actions to be very clearly set out; actually, some of that work has been done. For example, already, there's been a review of the governance. We're also looking at the kind of research that needs to be done in that area. I think what's clear, and something that's very much driving me as the Welsh language Minister, is this understanding that you reach 16 and you get this fall off a cliff in terms of the number of people who actually speak and use Welsh. So, that's the thing that we need to address, and that's why moving now into that area of further education is crucial. And the report, written by Delyth Evans, did suggest that we do need to move into this area but, actually, there wasn't necessarily a need for further funding in that area. But it may be something that we will consider, but it's something that we'll try and absorb, perhaps, from within the department.", "Kirsty Williams AM: A relatively modest amount of money was being made available this year to be able to kick-start some of this work, but we are mindful of the recommendations from the Evans report. So, future allocations will have to reflect the priorities within the implementation plan, and that's not just money that goes directly to y\u00a0coleg, but also trying to get better alignment between other budget lines that support the Welsh language, and making sure that all budget lines that could help on this agenda are aligned to the recommendations and the implementation report.", "Julie Morgan AM: Thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy, on this.", "Suzy Davies AM: Thank you. Just on\u00a0coleg cenedlaethol's extended remit, have you had\u2014? I haven't read the Evans report, but is there anything in there about the role of increased use of Welsh in adult community learning, for example? That's a further education pot, isn't it?", "Eluned Morgan AM: Yes, it is, and we are very much in touch with adult community learning, and they are aware of the responsibilities they have in relation to the Welsh language. The issue, of course, with adult education, is that they have undergone some quite dramatic cuts.", "Suzy Davies AM: Oh, yes, I don't mean the higher education sector that's taken over responsibility for this; I'm talking about community learning, low level, just having Welsh there. And, you know, as you mentioned yourself, post 16, people stop using it, so getting it in wherever you can as part of a strategy.", "Eluned Morgan AM: Yes. They're aware of that responsibility and we\u2014", "Suzy Davies AM: They're free to choose partners, then, are they, to help them deliver that?", "Eluned Morgan AM: And also to work with the new organisation that we've set up to promote the learning of Welsh, in particular, that is based in Carmarthen. So, that's something also that's being driven, and they're working closely, I think, on this.", "Suzy Davies AM: Oh, great, thanks.", "Kirsty Williams AM: There's lots of innovative practice. So, for instance, up in Wrexham, if a student has gone into the college to do A-levels, then they may decide to do those A-levels through the medium of English. But if they were previously in a Welsh-medium school, they are actively encouraged\u2014indeed, persuaded\u2014to do their Welsh baccalaureate through the medium of Welsh. So, they may be doing their A-levels in English, but if they've come from a Welsh-medium school, the college proactively seeks them out and makes sure that there is provision for them to do their Welsh bac qualification through the medium of Welsh, or, for instance, they are working very hard to form tutor groups. So, the tutor group\u2014you might be doing your qualifications in English, but your tutor group will be a Welsh-medium tutor group, so that you are placed\u00a0with other students who have come from Welsh-medium schools, and your tutor does all that tutor work through the medium of Welsh. So, there are other ways in which we can continue to help support children's linguistic ability, even if they have made a decision not to formally study their A-levels, for instance, or a course, through the medium of Welsh, and we're constantly looking at new ways. I think one particular aspect of the market\u2014if we call it that word\u2014that we're interested in are those students who've been to Welsh-medium schools, but at 16, perhaps, as I say, decide to go to a college. So, for instance, here in Cardiff, looking at childcare, and the opportunity\u2014you know, there's a sector where we know we need a Welsh-medium workforce.", "Suzy Davies AM: Yes, definitely.", "Kirsty Williams AM: So, again, it's trying to target those children, and track them from a previous Welsh-medium education into a college, capturing their language skills, and finding ways in which they can use them. Merthyr college\u2014there's a Welsh-medium champion in Merthyr college actively looking for children who have come from a Welsh-medium background, and they are allocated roles as Welsh-medium champions within the college, to promote. So, there are lots of innovative ways, especially in the FE sector, that they're looking to keep children's linguistic skills relevant, and they're using them, even if they make that decision to switch the language of their tuition.", "Suzy Davies AM: Well, that's encouraging to hear. My question was about community learning, where it's essentially older people who perhaps are coming back to education in a way that wasn't as formal as it was before, if I can put it like that\u2014so we don't lose sight of them as well. I've still got an abiding worry that there's a cohort in the middle here of people who we might lose, and maybe pass on bad attitudes towards the Welsh language to their children, despite the fact that those children now have huge opportunities to absorb Welsh language skills and make the most of them.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. The next questions are from Llyr.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you, Chair. I'd like to ask about the regional skills partnership\u2014partnerships, I should say\u2014because they are having a direct influence now on courses and provision in FE, and with degree apprenticeships in universities as well. You, I believe, received the Graystone review back in March, so could you tell us a bit about what was in it, and what the recommendations are?", "Eluned Morgan AM: So, some of the recommendations\u2014. So, we wanted to review it because it's still relatively new. They've only been up and running about two or three years. He brought out some positives\u2014things that we, I think, are doing well. I think they found that the voluntary partnership approach was quite effective. He did suggest that, actually, what they need to be producing is much shorter, sharper, focused reports. There was a suggestion of a lack of transparency, in terms of reporting from those regional skills partnerships, and that's obviously something now that we've undertaken to review. And there, I think, is an understanding that what we need to do now is to put in place those changes. But, on the whole, what we've done is to reinforce our commitment to the regional skills partnerships, and in particular now, through allocating \u00a310 million to further education colleges to respond directly to the wishes and the desires of the regional skills partnerships, you can see actually the status of the regional skills partnerships has just grown significantly. Because now there is an outcome as a result of their recommendations. So, you've seen quite a dramatic shift, I think, in the respect for regional skills partnerships over the past year.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: So, are there any recommendations in terms of governance as well\u2014", "Eluned Morgan AM: Yes.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: \u2014because, clearly, there may have been concerns about the way that people ended up being members of the partnerships? You touched on transparency\u2014clearly, that's an issue as well. So, just particularly on governance\u2014.", "Eluned Morgan AM: So, on governance, I think there was an understanding that that needs to be looked at again, and that we need to get the right people around the table. And what is interesting is, I think, because it was a voluntary approach, because now people can see an outcome, we're getting different people now really showing an interest in being a part of the regional skills partnerships. So, governance is something again we're going to be addressing and following up the recommendations on in that Graystone review. Is there anything to add to that?", "Huw Morris: Well, I was just going to say, I don't see why we couldn't share the review with you.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: That was going to be my next question.", "Huw Morris: That might be helpful. And we are actioning the recommendations from that review.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: The normal course of action would be, of course, to have published it and then to publish a Government response. Any reason why that wasn't done? I find it quite strange that you're saying that you're actually actioning the report and you still haven't published it. As a committee, we've not been party to any of that, really.", "Eluned Morgan AM: I don't see why that can't be done. There's nothing to hide here, so why wouldn't we? We're the people who commissioned the report\u2014", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: I'm the one asking the questions. [Laughter.] No, but you're right. I just find it strange. I just find it odd that that hasn't been published.", "Eluned Morgan AM: Okay. Well, we'll certainly get a copy of that to you.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Yes, okay.", "Huw Morris: May I just\u00a0say: we ask a number of people periodically to comment on what we do, and agencies we work with do the same. The status of those reports varies. I don't suppose we'd anticipated there would be the interest in this issue that there is and so, as the Minister said, there's no problem that I can see with that.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: And do you have a timeline in terms of by when you want to introduce some of the reforms that you're looking at now, because of this report?", "Eluned Morgan AM: Some of them have already been introduced, so we're not waiting. The transparency issue that I think there was a bit of concern about\u2014that's already been introduced. So, it's just about making sure that people understand what is going on in these regional skills partnerships. I think that's really important\u2014", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Well, quite, given the influence that they have\u00a0now. Yes, sure. Just another short one on the regional skills partnerships, really: how effective are they in supporting the planning and delivery of Welsh-medium provision in post-16?", "Eluned Morgan AM: I think there's more we can do in relation to that. But I think there are aspects where we're already changing in respect of specific\u00a0sectors. So, if you think about the care sector, for example, what we do need is more people\u00a0who have those skills to speak through the medium of Welsh in the\u00a0care sector. And, coming back to the point that was made earlier, what we're doing now is looking at the curriculum: to what extent can we include\u2014? You don't have to do your whole course through the medium of Welsh, but there are aspects that would be very useful. So, those kind of things are being taken on board now in terms of the courses. One of the things that the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol are looking at is building the resources that will be needed in order to mainstream those into, in particular, those\u00a0front-line service areas where we have a skills shortage.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. Diolch.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Cabinet Secretary, you know that\u00a0this committee has taken a very keen interest in the emotional and mental health of our young people. In the summer, the English universities Minister made an announcement about the development of a new mental health charter. That followed some concerns about young people\u00a0dying by suicide across the UK. Is Welsh Government expecting Welsh universities to sign up to that charter or are you planning to work on your own?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you for raising this. I think it's really important that whilst for many, many, many young people moving away from home and starting their degree course is an incredibly exciting time and something they look forward to hugely, it can bring significant stresses with it, especially for first-year students, who, as I said, are moving away, perhaps are suddenly responsible for finances in a way they've never been responsible for, for all the day-to-day living that perhaps they've relied on other people to assist them with. So, it can be quite a stressful time. So, it is right that we look at how we can support health and well-being for students, especially mental health and mental resilience. So, I very much welcome the work on the mental health\u00a0charter, and HEFCW\u00a0are engaged and keeping a very close eye on what's going on to see the opportunities for Welsh universities to participate in that. But this was on a recent agenda item that I had with HEFCW, and indeed with the\u00a0vice-chancellors, when I met them last week, or the week before last. So, they are developing their own strategic approach to well-being and health for students, which will be underpinned by a co-created action plan with the universities themselves on supporting students\u00a0with mental health problems in particular. So, the strategic approach and the\u00a0action plan are being developed by HEFCW\u00a0at the moment and HEFCW\u00a0are also meeting with colleagues from England and Scotland to see the opportunities for a universal approach across the UK to supporting students. The universities, when I met with them recently, all shared a commitment to do better in this particular area. One, because it's the right thing to do, but, actually,\u00a0stopping people from dropping out and not completing their courses obviously is of a financial benefit\u00a0to the institution. So, it's actually the right thing to do for their students, they want to do it for that reason, but, actually, there is a strong financial underpinning to ensure that students complete their studies. So, it's looking at, again, each university looking at individual approaches of how better they can do that. But it's not just responding to students who become unwell, it's\u00a0actually, 'What can we do to in the campus to maintain\u00a0good mental health?' So, rather than just trying to fix a problem once it's occurred, it's 'What can we do?' And you'll be aware of individual institutions\u00a0taking different approaches. It's not something that we dictate, but individual institutions\u2014when they do exams, how work is assessed and marked and graded\u2014are taking different steps to promote well-being, as well as then responding to situations where students become unwell. We do know that financial pressures can be a source of huge stress for students, so we are constantly working with the Student Loans Company to make sure that the services that they offer to people are as good as they can be, and that there are no unnecessary delays that, perhaps, put a student under pressure or give students worries about their financial situation. And I would argue our Diamond reforms, which allow students\u00a0access to a living wage\u2014for some students, completely by a grant, for some students, a combination of grant and loan, with no expectation at\u00a0all that your parents\u00a0will contribute, which is not the case in\u00a0other places where there is an expectation of parental contribution\u2014that actually, hopefully, addresses some of those financial worries that some students may have. But I am aware that if people are waiting for their grant or people are waiting\u00a0for their payments, that can be a source of stress. So, ensuring that we have good performance by the Student Loans Company is crucial.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. And I'm sure the committee's very interested to hear the update on that. Are you able to give us any indication of timescale\u00a0by which you'd expect HEFCW\u00a0and the individual universities to actually have this work in place?", "Kirsty Williams AM: I'm not sure, but I will write to the committee and let you know. In fact, we can probably provide, from Universities Wales and from the work that's going on centrally, a list of\u00a0proposals that are being undertaken.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you very much. The next question is from Dawn Bowden.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. I wanted to ask you about the pay dispute, and I know that you're not the employer, because\u00a0I know that's going to be the first answer\u2014", "Kirsty Williams AM: You're right, that is the first answer. [Laughter.] Well anticipated.", "Dawn Bowden AM: But we are in a stalemate here and you clearly have an interest in making sure that this dispute is resolved quickly\u00a0in the interest of the students and the reputation of the colleges et cetera, et\u00a0cetera. I can see how this dispute has arisen. When we've seen the teachers' pay settlement, we've seen FE settlements in England and Scotland higher than what's\u00a0on the table here. And I am concerned, and I do think this is where the Welsh Government does have a role, because\u00a0I am concerned that the employers seem to be using the funding issue as the reason not to have a reasonable settlement with staff. So, they've walked away from the table, they've said, 'One per cent, take it or leave it. Unless Welsh Government gives us any more money, that's the end of that.' And I'm really concerned about that, because\u00a0this is potentially going to have a major impact on whether we can recruit\u00a0and retain staff in FE colleges. And I look at the college in my constituency, Merthyr\u00a0college\u2014it's a tertiary college, they're providing A-level education across Merthyr\u00a0and they're astounding results they've been getting as well. I'm coming round to the question in a moment. It's really: what more do you think you can do as a Government to try to get these parties back round the table and not allow the dispute to become a political football?", "Eluned Morgan AM: Thanks very much for that. I think, first of all, you're absolutely right\u2014this is about ColegauCymru's negotiation, but we are keeping a close eye on the situation. I think it's probably worth emphasising that the reason this has come about, or part of the reason, is because\u00a0you've seen that pay settlement in relation to teachers' pay and we've had the consequential. So, sixth-form teachers are happy. The people actually providing the same teaching course in a different institution, you can understand why they may say, 'Something needs to change here.' The problem here is that it's about that, actually, that falls to the Welsh Government. We don't have that. Or at least it falls to FE colleges to fund that,\u00a0and it's up to them to come up with that proposal. We are keeping a close eye on things. I think it's fair to say that we'll wait until they get further along down the line, but we are extremely aware of the sensitivities of the situation.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you for that, Minister. When you say you're keeping a close eye on it, have you actually had conversations with ColegauCymru? Because I note what you just said there:\u00a0'We'll keep an eye on it and wait and see what's happening.' Well, all the unions are currently consulting. One has already balloted for industrial action. We could have the other unions also balloting for industrial action. I mean, this isn't something we want in the FE sector, clearly, so is there anything more proactive that Government could actually be doing to try to bring a resolution to this dispute?", "Eluned Morgan AM: Well, we are listening and speaking to ColegauCymru, and also we're aware of what the unions are saying as well. So, I think that's probably as far as we can go at this point. When they come to a conclusion, and when they come to us and say, 'Look, this is the consequence and this will finish'\u2014at this point, we have no idea where that settlement is likely to fall.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you.\u00a0Llyr.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Yes, thank you. Yes, we wouldn't expect you to make an announcement on this, because it's happening outside of Government, but there is a principle here, isn't there, in terms of pay equality between schoolteachers and FE? So, would you not wish to see a situation where we do have greater equality in that respect?", "Eluned Morgan AM: In relation to teaching, I think it's fair to say that we would wish to see pay equality in relation to teaching, yes.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Okay, thank you. You emphasise\u00a0'in relation to teaching'\u2014my next question is that, of course, within FE establishments you have teaching staff and non-teaching staff, and if there was to be some sort of increase, then would you not expect all staff to have that?", "Eluned Morgan AM: Well, let's see\u2014that's up to ColegauCymru\u00a0to negotiate and to discuss, so let's see what the outcomes are.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Because some of the non-teaching staff are the lowest paid, as well, aren't they? So, you know\u2014.", "Eluned Morgan AM: Let's wait for the outcome of the negotiations. I think we are very aware of the situation. ColegauCymru are in that negotiation. We're aware of what the requests are from the trade union members, and we'll wait to see what they come up with before responding formally.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Could I just briefly as well ask about pensions, because that's coming down the line, potentially, isn't it, and the impact that's going to have on FE? One college was saying it will cost them \u00a31 million if it happens next year. Are you thinking about any steps that you could take to support them, potentially, because obviously this is coming down the line, really, isn't it?", "Eluned Morgan AM: Well, I think, already, we've got the situation in relation to teachers, and again what we've seen is the consequential and the UK Government honouring that. Again, what we don't have, necessarily, is that money coming down from the UK Government for us to be able to support it in the way that we might like to. It's early days on this, but it's something, again, we're keeping an eye on.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: The fundamental question, really, is: if the money doesn't come down the line from Westminster, are you in a position to underwrite that?", "Eluned Morgan AM: Well, we'll wait until we see that situation arising, but we're aware that that is an issue that we're going to have to deal with in future.", "Llyr Gruffydd AM: Diolch.", "Lynne Neagle AM: In relation to the pay dispute, it's the committee's understanding that ColegauCymru's position is that, in order to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers, an additional 3.5 per cent or \u00a310.1 million is needed. Are you aware of that being their position?", "Eluned Morgan AM: We are aware of their position, yes.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The final question is from Hefin David.", "Hefin David AM: You will have had, Cabinet Secretary, a letter from\u00a0Professor Colin Riordan\u00a0on 26 September regarding essay mills, in which he refers to the other letter that was sent by him and 39 vice-chancellors regarding essay mills and the fact that it's legalised cheating. In the letter\u2014it was actually to me\u2014that was copied to you, he says: 'We have requested the UK Government commission the QAA to publish a draft Bill by or before the beginning of the next parliamentary session. We've also requested the Department for Education give support to the establishment of a UK centre for academic integrity, which would research, analyse and combat academic misconduct. Any support that the Welsh Government can provide in this regard will also be appreciated, so I'm copying this letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education.' Can you just give\u00a0me your opinions on that, please?", "Kirsty Williams AM: I think 'legalised cheating' is a polite way of describing what goes on. My officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the UK Government to see if we can co-ordinate a UK approach, which I think is necessary. I don't think there's any merit in us trying to do this on our own; it would be pointless. I hope that we can agree a formal approach as quickly as possible, and I will take every opportunity\u2014. We're trying to establish a meeting with the UK Minister for HE before Christmas, and I will take every opportunity that I can to ensure that we can take some very, very strong action in this regard. But it does have to be done at a UK level. I want people who attend our universities and who work hard to achieve the grades that they get not to be disadvantaged by people who look to find an easy way out and are not willing to put\u2014. I think it undermines the individual effort of individual students who are doing the right things, as well as the integrity of our system. I'm proud of the quality of the system that we have in the Welsh HE sector, and I want that maintained. I hope that we can agree a UK approach to ending this practice.", "Hefin David AM: Okay. And in addition to the specifics regarding the quality assurance agency and the proposed\u00a0centre for academic integrity, let's be clear: what we're talking about it outlawing those websites\u00a0that offer to write essays for cash.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. And quite often, very bad ones as well. [Laughter.]\u00a0My understanding is\u2014", "Hefin David AM: Well, they get through the system and they guarantee\u2014. The websites, and I've experienced this, and I mentioned it in First Minister's questions\u2014", "Kirsty Williams AM: You did.", "Hefin David AM: The websites\u00a0say to you, 'Unless\u00a0you tell anyone, you won't get caught', and students are believing that. The new student grant system\u2014some of that money will go to these websites.", "Kirsty Williams AM: Absolutely, and, unlike you, I have no experience of this myself\u2014", "Hefin David AM: Well, I have experience of it. I've not done it, but I've experienced it. [Laughter.]", "Kirsty Williams AM: I'm so old, Hefin, that such internet sites didn't exist when I was a student. [Laughter.] But, you know, I'm sure you listened to it too: a recent article, on a radio station, where, actually, it was an experiment just like you did\u2014a student deliberately\u00a0went through this process to expose, but, actually, what they got in return wasn't even very good. It was a particularly poor essay on the portrayal of women in Victorian literature, so they weren't even getting very good value for their money. [Laughter.] But, clearly, this is a terrible and abhorrent practice in our system, and, as I said, I will do everything that I can to work with colleagues across the United Kingdom to find a solution to this. If I thought it would help if we did it on our own, we could do that, but it won't help if we act unilaterally. It has to be a UK approach.", "Hefin David AM: And just\u2014final question\u2014with regard to the representations you've made, do you feel that the UK Government is open to this course of action?", "Kirsty Williams AM: Well, officials are the ones who have had those direct, face-to-face conversations, rather than me. I hope to do that when I meet the Minister, hopefully before Christmas. Huw, would you like to comment?", "Huw Morris: We haven't had anything formally, but I understand from what I've heard in England that there is an interest to do something. Whether that will take the form of a Bill in the timescale you've outlined, I'm not sure, but as the Minister said, we'll be exploring that with officials through the ministerial meetings.", "Hefin David AM: Okay, thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering all our questions? As usual, you'll have a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much for your time. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education regarding eligibility criteria for free school meals. I'd like to return briefly to that when we go into private. Paper to note 2: a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3: also from that Minister, which is his response to the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee on the Bill. And paper to note 4: also a letter from that Minister to the Finance Committee on the Bill. And the final paper to note is from Mind Cymru regarding the task and finish group on a whole-school approach to mental health, and I will update Members on that when we go into private.\u00a0Happy to note those? Item 4, then: can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content?

{"meeting_id": "m_val_15", "domain": "committee", "meeting_transcripts": ["Lynne Neagle AM: Good afternoon. Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I've determined that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. A record of proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups. Thank you all very much for your attendance today\u2014we appreciate your time. We've got lots of questions that we'd like to cover, which we'll go straight into, with questions from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Good afternoon. How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools?", "Vaughan Gething AM: Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales\u2014a child who's in critical care\u2014but that isn't confirmed. That's still a developing knowledge base. So, the rest of the world is still trying to understand that too. But the generals still apply\u2014that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: And in terms\u2014[Inaudible.]", "Vaughan Gething AM: Chair. Sorry. Excuse me, Chair. Sorry\u2014with apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe Si\u00e2n could repeat her question?", "Vaughan Gething AM: I can hear it, yes.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, Si\u00e2n, would you mind repeating that, please?", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus\u2014let's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales\u2014do we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children?", "Vaughan Gething AM: At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care\u2014. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. So, we can flex up our capacity. But the challenge in all of that this is\u2014it's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped.\u00a0If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment\u2014you don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day.", "Lynne Neagle AM: [Inaudible.]\u2014Si\u00e2n?", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Hello. Yes, those are the questions I had on that section.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Lovely. Thank you very much. Right, we'll move on now then to some question on access to health services from Dawn Bowden.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. Minister, just some concern that you will have heard about in terms of parents and carers maybe not taking their children into the healthcare system for other conditions while the coronavirus pandemic is with us. How are you monitoring that situation at the moment and have you had to look at your own commutation strategy in relation to that?", "Vaughan Gething AM: We've had to look at some specifics around communication, so challenges about not just different languages, but about how we get messages to people in a very different environment, and it's really challenging. So, for example, our health visitor service has absolutely not stopped. We've had to think about the way it works, and I had this conversation earlier this week with the chief nurse. But the bigger challenge are parents refusing to engage with the service. I understand people's fear and anxiety, but that then means that their family, and in particular their child, isn't getting the sort of proactive care that we would want them to have. So, there's a real concern both at the professional leadership end and for the chief nurse and for Ministers as well about how we can get through. That's actually about rebuilding people's confidence in the service, and that isn't straightforward because there's a broader concern about coronavirus still circulating. But I think for us it's really important to reiterate that we have thought again about how to provide the service. We've thought about how to protect staff and families and the very clear message to parents is to please make sure that when health and care professionals are calling to help and support your family, please discuss your concerns with them. We're doing even more remotely, via telephone and online as well. There are times you need to be physically in the same place, for example on routine vaccinations, because we certainly haven't stopped that programme either, and I really wouldn't want to see that one of the unintended consequences of what we've done is that if parents don't engage with that service, we could potentially see a rise in other diseases. We're all, I think\u2014not just you\u00a0in your constituency, but others who are on this call and\u00a0others as well\u2014seeing an occasional reappearance of measles, and that's because people didn't engage with the vaccination programme. I don't want, either myself or a different health Minister in the future, to be sat here talking about how in years to come the failure to engage in a vaccination programme has led to clearly avoidable but significant harm to children and young people and the communities they live in.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Jean, you wanted to come in.", "Vaughan Gething AM: You need to unmute yourself. Oh, no\u2014", "Professor Jean White: Thank you. I just want to add to what the Minister said. So, I approached the immunisation lead in Public Health Wales to see exactly what has been happening recently and they said at the very beginning of the outbreak parents were very reluctant about coming forward for their routine immunisations, but recently, through lots of energy from the immunisation clinics and the leads within it reaching out to families, that trend seems to have turned and there's now a much better attendance. One of the most important things we can do to protect our children is to make sure they have their vaccinations. So, yes, there was a bit of a downturn, but it does seem to be improving at the moment. Thank you.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Okay, thank you. And that answered my second question, Chair, so I'm happy to leave it there. Thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you very much. We're going to go on now to some questions about mental health from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. Si\u00e2n.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: It's a cause of great concern to us all, of course, in terms of the impact of this crisis on mental health and well-being among our children and young people. So, what assessment has the Government undertaken of the impact on these aspects in young people and what work is being done to understand the impact of the pandemic? What longer term measures will be put in place and what support services will be put in place?", "Vaughan Gething AM: Again, I think it's helpful that you've already heard from the education Minister last week, because I think the first of her key principles for returning to school is the impact on the emotional health and well-being of children. So, children's mental health was a central concern and remains so for both myself and the education Minister. Part of the honest challenge, again, is that we don't fully understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children but we do expect there will have been an impact. So, we're working together with both health boards and our own knowledge and analytical services across the Government to both try to further understand what that is and the difference. Until we have more contact with families, we may not fully understand that, and that's a real point of concern for me. In all of the unknowns within this, the impact on mental health and well-being is absolutely one of them, because we're looking at how we then develop not just a recovery plan for the economy but a recovery plan around mental health, how we support people, and that will have to be informed by the understanding of what's happening when we get more engagement with families about the level of need, and then how we need to think about that. Obviously, it's a key factor for their return to school, but, actually, for the life children and young people lead outside the school environment, and that will be difficult because we're going to phase out of lockdown\u2014it's not going to be a one-hit measure. That absolutely isn't going to happen. We're going to be looking at, at each point, what difference has been made, what more we can do. And, again, there are the efforts we're making to make sure that our online support services and our telephone support services\u2014that we keep on reminding people that they're there and are available, and we want people to make use of them, because I know, as this committee said, we'd much rather be able to support people and intervene earlier rather than wait until there's a much bigger problem in a period of months in the future.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: So, in reality, there's been no assessment undertaken because it's difficult to do that. So, the full picture in terms of the outcomes of the crisis\u2014you don't know what they are at the moment as things stand.", "Vaughan Gething AM: We can't know, because we don't have that level of contact. There is a development\u2014. I wouldn't say that no work's being done, but I couldn't tell you honestly that that work is finalised and we have a definitive understanding of the picture. If I tried to say that, then I'm sure you'd ask me, 'How on earth can you say that? If you're not having regular contact with people, you can't possibly understand the picture.' And it's much better to say, 'We don't understand the full picture. We know there'll have been an impact. We're working alongside health boards and others, but we'll know more as we carry on having more contact with families.' I'll look at a variety of different areas, again, both to reform the recovery plan, but also then to understand what we need to do at various points in the future, and the picture that we're seeing isn't straightforward and we need to make sure that we don't try to pretend to ourselves or to the public that there is a one-off measure that will allow us to be successful in all the areas that we'd want to be.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: But can you give the committee an assurance today that this area of mental health and well-being is going to be a priority for you as health Minister?", "Vaughan Gething AM: Of course. Not just on the work we've done in the past; not just because it's one of the key principles for the education Minister about the reopening of schools, but it is a real worry list for me about how we understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and to move forwards, that we don't end up with an entire generation of children and young people who grow up with a range of damage because we haven't thought about what that will look like. So, the mental health recovery plan will of course be of very real importance to me. In amongst all the other priorities I have, I'm certainly not going to allow the mental health and well-being of children and young people to be forgotten.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: And how does the current capacity in terms of child and adolescent mental health services compare to service capacity prior to the coronavirus outbreak in Wales? Have you had to shift some resources over from CAMHS, for example, in order to deal with more general aspects of coronavirus?", "Vaughan Gething AM: No, we've actually got\u2014. Maybe perhaps it might be helpful, Chair, if Tracey Breheny could say something about the way that we're monitoring the impact we have, in terms of we've got a reporting tool, but also weekly contact with leads in CAMHS services.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Tracey.", "Tracey Breheny: Of course. Thanks, Minister. Yes, on that question, we moved pretty quickly at the beginning of the pandemic phase to put in place, as the Minister said, a weekly monitoring tool of all local health boards, so through that tool, we look at that every week in terms of collecting information. Whilst national reporting's been stood down, we are picking up assurance through that tool on things like staff sickness in CAMHS services, referral numbers and so on, so we do have that tool in place, and at the moment, that's telling us that the system can meet the capacity; has the capacity to meet need.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Have CAMHS staff been shifted over to do other work during this virus outbreak?", "Tracey Breheny: There has been some movement, as I'm saying, around health boards, particularly where in the first phase of the epidemic the concentration was on in-patient provision, providing critical care, but my understanding is from the latest tool that we looked at last week, those staff are gradually not just returning to work from self-isolation or whatever, or from different parts of the system.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: And then, what about the capacity for CAMHS primary mental health services? Has there been a reduction in that capacity since the beginning of the pandemic in terms of in-patients? Because that's what I'm hearing, that there has been such a reduction, but how are those patients then treated and served?", "Tracey Breheny: In terms of in-patient capacity, that is in the system in both the north Wales and in the south Wales unit at the moment. There were some discharges of young people, but we've had the assurance that that was only undertaken where it was clinically safe to do so and where the community support was in place.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: And finally in this section from me, given that schools are of course closed and that schools are so very important in terms of signposting young people towards services, how can young people access appropriate services\u2014online services, for example? How are they signposted towards those services at the moment?", "Vaughan Gething AM: Well, we've not closed off general practice and, as you know, we've expanded the ability for people to access services in an online manner. We've expanded a range of telephone advice services, so the telephone advice service we already provide, we've made sure that's maintained, and both myself and the deputy Minister have referred to that on a number of occasions. I think the real struggle and the real difficulty is actually how you punch through different messages when the broader news agenda is so overwhelmingly focused on headline messages in other areas. That is, again, a worry for me, but the communications we have within the health and care system, people should know where to refer people to and how to provide access to both telephone and online support that continues to be available, and actually, as I say, we've expanded that right across our healthcare system. That's what I\u2019m keen to see continue into the future. Whatever the post-COVID-19 world is, I don't want to miss out on the progress we have made in the online provision of services. Of course, most children and young people expect to be able to access services in an online manner already.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: But, of course, there will be some who are missed; they may fall between two stools because they won\u2019t know where to turn.", "Vaughan Gething AM: Yes, and that, again, comes back to our challenge of how we help children and young people in their context, with their families, to know where support and advice and guidance is. Many people are defaulting to their general practitioner if they can't find advice somewhere else, so that's why there's the information we're providing through general practice to signpost people, so those pathways haven\u2019t been closed off. It's about making sure that people have alternative means that they\u2019re prepared to use at this point in time. If we go back to where we started this evidence session, we were talking about the difficulty of families who don't want to engage in a traditional person-to-person contact or being in the same room as someone else or allowing people into their home. So, there's a real challenge about how we make the service available, but then encourage people to take it up, so that we don\u2019t see much greater harm that we have to try and resolve at a later point.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. I've got a supplementary from Suzy Davies, and can I remind Ministers about concise answers, please? Suzy.", "Suzy Davies AM: Yes, thank you. Just as we're speaking about children and young people's mental health, I wonder if you can confirm whether you've seen the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child's reports about what they call the grave physical and psychological effect on children and young people, and whether the operational guidance you've given out is responding to that in any way, or maybe there was something in that that you hadn\u2019t thought of and you can respond to as we go along.", "Vaughan Gething AM: I, personally, haven't read that advice, but the Government's already concerned about the direct physical and mental health impact of lockdown restrictions. You don't need to be a parent to recognise that that\u2019s a potential issue for children and young people. But, I'm sure\u2014. I haven't read it, but that's been signposted, so I can check with officials if they have and if that would change the advice and the position that we're already adopting, because we do regularly look at a range of advice from a range of sources, including the UN, the World Health Organization and others.", "Suzy Davies AM: Thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, and we are going to come onto children's rights. But, as you know, Minister, the prevention of young suicide is a cause that is very close to my heart. Can I ask what assessment the Welsh Government has made of an increase in suicide amongst children and young people during this pandemic and because of this pandemic?", "Vaughan Gething AM: Apart from the general concern that I've expressed on mental health generally, we are already investigating, we're having a\u2014. We've commissioned, through the Government, the delivery unit to work with the national advisory group, including Dr Ann John and other people, to review the current, unexpected deaths during the start of the pandemic here in Wales, because we want to try to understand the wider concerns about the potential effects of the restrictions on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and if that is leading to a spike in suicide or not. So, that's why we've commissioned that review to be carried out with the current numbers of unexpected deaths that we have, so we're able then to provide a report to understand where we are. My understanding is that we should have a report on that review before the end of this month and, obviously, I know the committee\u2019s got an interest, so if it's helpful we can write to you once we've had a chance to receive the report and to look at it.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Yes, please. Thank you. In terms of provision of crisis care, then, how has that been impacted by the pandemic? Are those crisis services available for children and young people who need them at the moment?", "Vaughan Gething AM: Yes, they continue to be available. We still have seven-day-a-week crisis care. We've made clear that mental health services, including those for children and young people, are essential services to be provided. They're not services to be scaled down. They were not part of the series of measures that I stopped within the health service on 13 March. We have built up those crisis care services over a period of time, and the last thing we want to see is to see them disappear during this period of time when there are well-understood concerns about emotional and mental health.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Moving on to perinatal mental health, this morning I hosted a round-table with the NSPCC where we heard about lots of good practice that's going on in terms of supporting new mothers and their families in this period, but I wonder if you can tell the committee what you are doing as a Government to make sure that there is consistent perinatal support for all women across Wales in what is a difficult time for any new mother, let alone in a pandemic.", "Vaughan Gething AM: We continue, again, to provide our perinatal mental health service. That's not been stopped either. We've also been looking at how that's provided on a phone or online basis where possible, because again the same concerns exist about physical contact with people. So, we're looking to make sure that the progress isn't lost that we've made. We know there is more to go. So, the service may have changed, but it still absolutely exists. And again, part of the challenge in all of this is about the pause or the interruption in work to create the in-patient capacity that I've previously committed to. So, I want to understand what that really means, but again the problem is, at this point in the pandemic, I can't give you an answer about what that means for that in-patient provision. We're still committed to it, but I'm concerned about the time frame\u2014that is partly about the length and the extent. But again, I'm really impressed by the continuing commitment of our staff to deliver this service for women in what is a particularly uncertain time. It's difficult enough in terms of the challenge in terms of perinatal mental health in normal times, about people being prepared to come forward and then receiving the sort of response they'd want, and even more so now.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Is the Welsh Government aware that there's apparently been a decrease in the numbers of women being willing to look at mother and baby unit provision, and will you be taking that into account in your planning? Because, obviously, we wouldn't want people to think that was because of a lack of need; it's down to fear and the lockdown.", "Vaughan Gething AM: Yes, we're aware there's been a reduction in people wanting to make use of the service\u2014or being prepared to make use of the service is probably a better phrase\u2014because we know that's the same with a range of other areas. There aren't fewer people having strokes than there were at this period of time last year; the reason why the figures are different is the way that people are behaving because of their concerns about coronavirus. So, I certainly wouldn't be using this period of time to plan for the need that exists for a facility that we want to create. So, I'm happy to give that assurance, Chair.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. The next questions are from Suzy Davies.", "Suzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. It's a straightforward one, really. Obviously, we have the detail of the third sector resilience fund and the\u2014there are two funds, aren't there, for third sector organisations? But can you give us some indication of how much of that support is being targeted to children and young people, and perhaps you can specifically mention how much of the \u00a36.3 million for hospices is for children's hospices? I don't mind who answers that one.", "Lynne Neagle AM: The Deputy Minister would like to come in, I think.", "Julie Morgan AM: Yes. Certainly, I'm sure the committee is aware, as Suzy has said, of the funds that are available for third sector services. The Deputy Minister and the Chief Whip, of course, announced on 6 April the \u00a324 million Welsh Government third sector COVID-19 response fund, and that of course is more than we would have had as a result of consequentials from the UK Government. They can also benefit from the \u00a3400 million economic resilience fund, but I am aware that some groups don't benefit from that and they may not qualify for that. So, we've also got third sector support being delivered by WCVA, such as the voluntary services emergency fund, which supports volunteering, and the third sector resilience fund, supporting organisations to stay afloat. We are working very closely with the third sector on issues such as support for fostering services, care leavers and repurposing funding so that they can support the crises. Voices from Care Cymru has developed a specific offer for care leavers, and the Fostering Network provides extended helplines. We've got lots of examples of third sector partners working with children and young people. Childline bases in Wales remain open and operational, and are still providing information and support. And, actually, about 50 per cent of contact with Childline at the moment is to do with COVID-19. NSPCC has put together a support page for young people about COVID-19. The NSPCC UK helpline have also reported a decrease in calls resulting in a referral to children's social services at the start of the lockdown period, but, since then, the numbers have actually risen. So, there are lots of examples of help for children. Meic, Action for Children, and, of course, Voices From Care Cymru have come up with their own specific package. In terms of the actual percentage that is being spent on children, I can't give you an actual figure for that, but, certainly, there are a whole range of projects that are there helping children. I think the Minister for Health and Social Services will be able to respond to the hospice question.", "Vaughan Gething AM: It's about \u00a31.5 million from the \u00a36.3 million that's gone to T\u0177 Gobaith and T\u0177 Hafan, Suzy.", "Suzy Davies AM: Thank you very much for that. So, it's about 25 per cent. Perhaps if you could ask the Deputy Minister, when she's in a position to do so, to let us have a note. Before we finish on this point, could I ask the Deputy Minister, again, about whether any of the things you've been talking about now is additional money, because, obviously, you mentioned yourself one of these funds is \u00a324 million. Some of the work you mentioned is continuity of existing work. So, again, if you don't have the answer to hand, perhaps you could send us a note in due course about how much extra is going in.", "Julie Morgan AM: Yes. I think most of those things I mentioned are things that are already there, and the \u00a324 million is for support and extra help. So, any more information, I can send to you.", "Suzy Davies AM: Lovely. Thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you very much. The next questions, then, are from Dawn Bowden on safeguarding and child protection.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Deputy Minister, because one of the questions I was going to ask was around some of the work that you've been doing with the third sector on safeguarding and child protection, and I think you've covered that. But what I'm particularly keen to find out is how you're monitoring the impact of coronavirus on child protection and safeguarding in the round. I know the health Minister raised this as a concern in Plenary only recently, and it's really how we are monitoring it, what concerns have been identified, and how we're going to start to tackle some of those.", "Julie Morgan AM: Yes. Thank you very much, Dawn, for that question. Obviously, it is difficult to monitor if there's not easy access to the children that we're referring to, and that's why we have been trying to encourage the vulnerable children to go into school or childcare settings. And there's been a lot of encouragement for that happen. The Minister, the director of education and the director of social services sent out a joint letter recently to all the local authorities, asking them to try to encourage the vulnerable children and the families to get the children to go to school. In fact, we've now got 890 vulnerable children attending school settings, and that's the highest number that we've had at all since the opening of the scheme. But it's still only a tiny drop in the ocean. But it's very good, and it is progress that the numbers attending are now going up. But, of course, there are a lot of children who are not attending school and the social services are not necessarily seeing. There has been a drop in safeguarding referrals to social services. Those numbers are now beginning to go up, but there certainly was a significant drop, which is a great deal of concern. One local authority, in fact, reported a drop of 27 per cent in terms of safeguarding referrals compared to this time last year. So, I issued a written statement on 1 May, setting out the work taken forward under our cross-departmental vulnerable children, young people and safeguarding work stream, and encouraging people to report any safeguarding concerns there are. Because, obviously, we are dependent on the public authorities\u2014you know, schools and health services\u2014to report any concerns, and at the moment, obviously, they're not there to report them. So, we have made this public appeal for everyone to look out for each other, and I was very interested in what Si\u00e2n Gwenllian told me about what was being done in Anglesey in terms of sending out a message via social media to get people to look and listen, and to raise their concerns, because, obviously, safeguarding is the concern of everybody in the community. But I think that we are reassured in terms of our contact with the local authorities that they are, in fact, keeping close touch, as far as they possibly can, with all the children that are vulnerable. For those where it is very critical, face-to-face contact is still taking place, and there are imaginative ways of trying to keep in touch with all the other children and families. So, it is a difficult situation and we are concerned about it, but I think as much as possible is being done.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Jean, you wanted to come in on that.", "Professor Jean White: Just to add to what the Deputy Minister was saying, the health visiting service has not been stopped or stepped back. It has consolidated some of the ways that it does the Healthy Child Wales Programme, but, for those families that are identified as having particular need or have children that are particularly vulnerable, all the normal contacts have been maintained, so they're not unseen to the normal health visiting service. That covers both Flying Start and general health visiting areas. Thank you.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Jean, for that, and, Deputy Minister, would there be any value at this point in actually revisiting the current Welsh Government definition and guidance around vulnerable children, in terms of who we identify as vulnerable? Because this opens up a whole new group of children that are not necessarily known to services but can still be vulnerable. So,it's just looking at the current guidance that we have. Do you think that needs revisiting at all?", "Julie Morgan AM: The definition of vulnerable children and young people includes those with a social worker and with statements of special educational needs, and the most vulnerable of these should be prioritised. But we have now looked at this again, and we've set out an expanded definition, and we intend to publish that this week. This does include discretion for local authorities to have some flexibility and to be able to offer a place for those who may be on the edge of receiving care and support if they are known to be vulnerable by the school or by family support services. Because, obviously, the children that we know about, we know about, but there are those other children who may be on the edge of care\u2014the children that we've been trying very hard, as part of our policies in the Welsh Government, to keep with their families, with a lot of support. Those are the ones that we also want to support. So, we are giving discretion to the local authorities in order to have a degree of flexibility, and that will be published this week.", "Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you. Thank you, Chair.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We're going to move on now, then, to talk about looked-after children and children on the edge of care, with questions from Janet Finch-Saunders.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair. Can you set out the impact the coronavirus emergency has had on the care system, including edge-of-care services, and where have there been areas of concern?", "Julie Morgan AM: Well, local authorities have obviously had to change their working practices in response to the COVID emergency, so a red-amber-green rating\u00a0risk assessment was adopted by all local authorities at the start of the pandemic to ensure that vulnerable children and families receive the right way of receiving services and the frequency of contact from the services. This is being dealt with on a case-by-case basis, so every case that is known is being RAG rated and services are being linked to that. Also, there is very close contact between Welsh Government officials and the local authorities. There are weekly meetings between officials and the heads of the children's services. I can't speak too highly, really, about the amount of support and mutual work that has been going on. We've been assured that there have been no significant increases in the numbers of looked-after children, and the number of placement breaks are minimal. The other interesting good point is the children services workforce remains at 90 per cent plus, and, obviously, that is a great testimony to the dedication of the workforce. So, there's very close contact. The children are all being monitored individually, and I think in the circumstances we're all doing what we possibly can. I know that Albert Heaney is able, probably, to respond in more detail to the contacts, if you'd like to have that.", "Lynne Neagle AM: I think we'll move on to the next section. Can I remind everyone again: sharp focused questions and concise answers? Janet.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thanks. How is Welsh Government ensuring that vulnerable children have access to the necessary technology to maintain contact with their social workers and other support workers and networks?", "Julie Morgan AM: It is normal practice to ensure that children and families do have appropriate access to technology to keep in touch with social workers, so that is part of our normal practice. We're very keen as a Welsh Government that no children are left behind in their education during this period. So, last month, as you will know, the Minister for Education announced \u00a33 million of funding to help digitally excluded learners so that they've got access to the internet, so that they can fully participate in online learning. So, we do normally ensure that they've got digital contact for social workers.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Can you set out the picture regarding children's residential care? What are the challenges these care settings are facing, and have any children's homes closed?", "Julie Morgan AM: Residential children's homes are not really reporting any particularly difficult issues, and certainly they have been able to resolve any issues that have happened. So, I'm very pleased to report that. We obviously expect all children in residential care to be supported, and to keep contact with their families and with their siblings, and that is going on, although it may be by technology rather than face to face. We know that some young people have found the social distancing a challenge, and I think it\u2019s easy for us to understand that they have found that quite difficult. So, there have been a few issues related to that, but, where that has happened, local authorities have been able to resolve that on a case-by-case basis, and really there are not any major issues. In terms of residential care, Hillside is functioning well\u2014no reporting issues. The staffing levels are normal. There are fewer children and young people there, so, in fact, there's been an opportunity to give a great deal of attention to the children, and I think we've had very good reports about how that has happened. So, I am absolutely reassured by our officials here that everything is as well as it could be. I also meet with the children's commissioner once a week, who is an independent source, and she said when I met her last week, 'Well, as far as we know, it's all good news'. So, I don't think we have any concerns at the moment about the residential care.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. Moving on to foster care, how is Welsh Government working with local authorities to meet the challenges set out by the Association of Fostering and Adoption Cymru and its fostering guidelines?", "Julie Morgan AM: We have worked with the fostering organisations. We have had close communications with them, and we've supported AFA Cymru to develop guidance for foster carers, and that guidance has been very strongly welcomed across the sector. We're working with the third sector. I think I mentioned before specific issues such as support for fostering services and, of course, care leavers. The Fostering Network has extended its helpline hours, and, of course, Voices from Care\u2014I mentioned them before\u2014have developed this particular offer of support for care leavers. I've been reassured, as well, from Voices from Care that the young people appear to be more stable now\u2014that they have contact with. But that's online help for them. So, we have had quite a lot of contact with the fostering services.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: So, the final point on that, then: the Fostering Network and others, as you know, have called for foster parents who can temporarily no longer foster due to the current virus emergency to be paid a retainer, with all foster carers receiving extra financial support for additional expenses. What is your position on this, please?", "Julie Morgan AM: Well, we haven't had any specific representations from local authorities asking for support for foster carers, but some local authorities have paid retainers and some people, I believe, have increased the amount of money that they are paying. They've also given support for various activities and things\u2014have helped sometimes, I think, with broadband access and that sort of issue. And, obviously, foster carers who do require additional support should be approaching their local authorities or the independent fostering agency.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. Albert, I just wanted to check there wasn't anything you wanted to add, please.", "Albert Heaney: Thank you very much, Chair. I think the only thing to add was relating to monitoring. The Minister has indicated that we are speaking weekly with heads of children's services, and we do now have a data collection that's been implemented to capture the critical data in relation to the children's services. So, that will assist us in our monitoring arrangements going forward. Thank you, Chair.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you very much. And the next questions, then, are from Suzy Davies.", "Suzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. I just wanted to have a quick answer from probably the Minister, I think, about the primary legislation and the regulations that followed, about which children's rights impact assessments have been done. Have any been done, and can they be shared with the committee if they have? Sorry, Deputy Minister\u2014my mistake.", "Julie Morgan AM: Well, it's been a very difficult time, as you appreciate, in terms of having to make legislation very quickly, and it hasn't been possible to do the impact assessments that we would normally do. However, I am very pleased to say that we're actually launching a survey of children. We're going to be launching it next week. And this is to try to get from children their views of what's happened, what we've been doing, and their views on the whole COVID-19 situation. So, we're doing this in conjunction with the children's commissioner and with Young Wales and with the Youth Parliament. So, this is an online survey that we hope will be going out to thousands of children, and we will get their response in terms of what are the important issues that have arisen for them, what they feel about what's happened during this period, what they feel about the way that we've dealt with the schools, the way that they've had to cope in not going school and being at home for so long. And so we're trying to get feedback from young people. So, I'm very pleased that we're doing that, but, in terms of an impact assessment, it has been very difficult, as I'm sure you can imagine, to be able to do those at these times. I think that Albert wants to come in on that.", "Suzy Davies AM: Yes, because I'll pursue that in a sec.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Albert.", "Albert Heaney: Thank you. Thank you, Chair, and I think Nicola indicated before me, so apologies, Nicola. Just to say for the committee, really importantly, that we haven't introduced any easements in relation to children's services legislation. I think that's really quite crucial. So, from a Welsh context, the standards that are in place do remain, so therefore there wouldn't have been a necessity for us to do a children's rights impact assessment in relation to the primary legislation. I think that's particularly a strong point to us in Wales, both in terms of safeguarding arrangements, but also ensuring that children's rights are protected at a crucial time.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Nicola.", "Nicola Edwards: Thanks. In terms of childcare and education, we're obviously looking at the provisions under the coronavirus Act to allow us to maybe ease some of the statutory requirements, and we are going to be undertaking a full suite of impact assessments on those. Obviously, the coronavirus Act itself was UK Government legislation and they ran their own impact assessments, but, in terms of how we implement it in the childcare and education space\u2014and I think Albert was just saying the same thing\u2014we definitely will be looking at those impacts in terms of going forward.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, just to come back on that then, are you saying to me that, as a result of the various coronavirus regulations that we've had, no assessments for children's needs have been postponed, cancelled or done very quickly online rather than in person?", "Julie Morgan AM: Well, I think, as Albert said, that there was no relaxation of regulation for children's social care. You know, that's\u2014there haven't been any in Wales.", "Suzy Davies AM: No, but that's what\u2014. There's no relaxation, but what's happening in practice? We're down on staff across all our councils and in our third sectors\u2014who's doing the children's needs assessments, particularly for young carers?", "Julie Morgan AM: Well, I\u2014. Albert, can you answer that?", "Albert Heaney: I think the first thing to say to the committee is that, going back, we took a very strong line at the beginning that we weren't going to introduce easements in requirements to children's social services. Of course, through the way that practitioners and social work practitioners have to operate, they are having to operate through a different time. So, assessments are still taking place for child protection and safeguarding concerns; assessments are still taking place, and especially in relation to\u2014as you mentioned\u2014young carers, to support their needs. So, arrangements\u2014[Inaudible.] But they're having to be slightly differently done\u2014so, some of the technology, and keeping in contact and keeping those visits. So, we've used, for example, the St David's Day fund to make sure that care leavers are well supported in terms of having contact and are accessible and able to engage as well. So, we're having to be a little bit more\u2014and social services departments are having to be a little bit more\u2014innovative in the use of technology in the way that they've engaged as well. But personal visits are taking place, and visits especially, as the Minister mentioned earlier on\u2014they actually individually assess each case to determine the frequency of visits, to make sure that those contacts are maintained with children at a critical time.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay. Thank you. I don't want to take this much further, but personal visits and social distancing could be slightly problematic. I just want to finish with this one question, if I may. We've had recommendations from the Carers Trust, or Carers Trust Wales. Have they been accepted by Government, and is it those that are driving the agenda of the task and finish group that you announced the other day, Deputy Minister?", "Julie Morgan AM: Well, those will certainly be considered by the task and finish group. I've had a letter from the Carers Trust about those issues, and we are setting up this group, as you know, and we will be looking at those issues in the group.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay. Thank you. Any steal on when that might report?", "Julie Morgan AM: I don't have that at the moment.", "Suzy Davies AM: Okay. Thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Maybe we could have a note on that, Deputy Minister. Can I just say, we are running short of time? We did start late, so, if the Ministers are happy, we'll carry on until 2.10 p.m.\u20143.10 p.m.\u2014if that's okay. And the next questions are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: [Inaudible.]", "Lynne Neagle AM: Hold on a sec, Si\u00e2n, we've lost translation again. Can we just see what can be done to get the translation back? Sorry, Si\u00e2n. Is there anyone who can help with the translation? There you go, Si\u00e2n. Thank you.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: You will know, Deputy Minister\u2014because we have discussed this in private session\u2014my major concerns with regard to the childcare sector, and what kind of childcare sector we will have at the end of this crisis, as families start to return to the workplace. There are still some childcare providers who are falling between the cracks and aren't receiving financial support. Do you agree\u2014are there people who are still not being supported, and why isn't the Welsh Government able to provide that support for everyone in the childcare sector?", "Julie Morgan AM: Thank you, Si\u00e2n, for that question. And I know that we have had a discussion about this before. Basically, we are aware that there are some sectors in the childcare sector that do fall through some of the loops. We have guaranteed that we will pay the money for the childcare offer for three months. So, that is guaranteed to them, and they are able to take advantage of the Government's job retainer scheme, but that does mean that there is a problem, as I think we've discussed before, of the double funding issue, and that is something that we have been trying to resolve and there have been discussions with the Treasury in Whitehall about ways forward on this. I'm going to ask Nicola to come in in a minute, because she's much more up to date with the discussions about that, but, so far, I don't think very much progress has been made on that. But we are looking to see if there are any other ways that we can get help to the childcare sector, and I'm actually following this meeting with a meeting with the Deputy Minister for equality and chief whip, who is responsible for the voluntary sector, because obviously many of the groups that we're talking about would come under the voluntary sector, because they have voluntary committees, but they fall between many stools, because they rent premises rather than own premises and they don't have high turnovers that would qualify them for some of these grants. So, perhaps I could ask Nicola to come in to expand on that.", "Nicola Edwards: Absolutely.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Briefly, if possible.", "Nicola Edwards: I'll try and be brief, because I'm conscious of time. So, some childcare settings can access funding under the small business rate relief scheme, but certainly not all of them; some of them can access funding under the economic resilience fund, and, as the Deputy Minister said, we're following up for some of them to be able to access funding under the third sector resilience funding. All of the childcare settings can apply for the UK Government's coronavirus job retention scheme, but there are some complications around that in that it's a salary-based scheme and you can't claim two types of public funding for the same individual member of staff. So, if you were using funding under the childcare offer to pay for a particular member of staff's salary, you can't access CJRS and furlough that individual with Government money as well, and that has led to some confusion and complication about how that balances, which we're trying to work through with the sector and with local authorities around the rules and regulations that the Treasury and HMRC have put in place around that. Alongside that, there's a whole range of different loans and services that are available. Some of those are less attractive to some childcare settings, but they are still available and Business Wales is offering support and advice for settings on how they can help weather this storm and support their workers as best they can. We're also having some conversations now with our economy colleagues and with Business Wales about what happens next, the recovery and the return of the sector, and we've just come out of a meeting with the childcare sector around the support they think they would need to have in place to be able to return from this as well. So, it's a topic that's very much live at the moment.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: I'm sure you can share my concerns and the concerns of Cwlwm, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector?", "Julie Morgan AM: Well, that is what we're looking to see\u2014if we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. So, it is a very worrying situation. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, Si\u00e2n, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers?", "Julie Morgan AM: I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and so\u2014. I mean, that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics.", "Nicola Edwards: I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them?", "Julie Morgan AM: Yes, that would be very good.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Very briefly.", "Nicola Edwards: Yes. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you very much.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way?", "Julie Morgan AM: Well, that is the intention\u2014that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please.", "Suzy Davies AM: Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the\u2014well, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that?", "Julie Morgan AM: Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, really\u2014that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. And the Welsh Government has also provided guidance about staying at home and away from others. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. As usual, you will receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr.", "Vaughan Gething AM: Diolch yn fawr, Chair.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward.

Yeah , I was just wondering because we 're uh running out of the un - backed - up disk space on", "Grad A: Well , that was the other point .", "PhD F: Oh , was that another one ?", "Grad A: Yep , that 's another agenda item .", "PhD F: OK . I 'll wait .", "Grad A: So , uh  But that is a good point so we 'll get to that , too . Um , DARPA demo status , not much to say . The back - end stuff is working out fine .

Yep .", "PhD D: because the um", "Grad A: Well Transcriber is Tcl - TK , very generic with Snack ,", "PhD D: we have m m We have more Windows machines to run the", "PhD C: Yeah .", "Grad A: so basically anything you can get Snack to run on , it will work .", "PhD D: Right .", "PhD C: Yeah . Yeah but  But the problem is the version Transcriber works with , the Snack version , is one point six whatever and that 's not anymore supported . It 's not on  on the web page anymore .

Ugh !", "PhD D: I  I wonder if  if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along", "PhD C: Yeah . Yeah .", "Grad A: We have  Yeah b it 's just hasn't made it into the release yet .", "PhD D: We have ? Oh . Oh , OK .", "PhD F: So did you um put the uh   the NT version out on the uh Meeting Recorder page ? Or", "PhD C: No , I haven't done that yet . I 'm  oh Nope .

Just three different  It 's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it 's", "PhD D: So  So  Well", "Grad E: I mean we could do it in Matl -  I mean you could do it in a number of different places I 'm sure .", "PhD D: But  But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the  you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is  that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform .", "PhD C: Yep .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Professor B: Yes .", "Grad E: Yeah , that 'd be very cool .", "Grad A: It 'd be easy enough to add that .

Yeah , maybe we could l look into that .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Grad A: But it  it seems to me that I c", "PhD C: And", "Grad A: It doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary .

Do you mean like", "PhD F: Like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo .", "Grad E: OK .", "Grad A: Yeah , jus Yeah .", "PhD F: Is that what you mean ?", "Grad A: It just seems to me jus", "Grad E: It would be cool to see it", "PhD F: Yeah .", "Grad E: It would be cool like to see  to hear it and see it ,", "PhD C: And to hear it . Yeah . Yeah .", "Grad E: and see the pitch contours also .", "Grad A: Sure , but I don't think  I  You can do all that just statically in", "PhD C: Yeah .", "Grad E: I think it would lose  Yeah , I mean y", "Grad A: Just record the audio clip and show an image and I think that 's", "Grad E: Right , right . I just thought if you meant slides I thought you meant like just  like  um view graphs or something .", "Professor B: You know , wh Yeah . So . Uh , no , we 're talking about on the computer and  and um , I think when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting ,", "Grad E: Right .", "Professor B: we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have and ,  the more live , the better , but uh , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent .

Yeah . Right . Well , I mean that 's plenty of read speech data . I mean , Wall Street Journal ,  uh , take one example .", "Grad A: Yeah . That 's right .", "PhD D: But um .

Although we  I mean , it 's not that many fewer and  and  and we take a KLT anyway so we could", "PhD D: Right . Exactly .", "Professor B: Yeah .", "PhD D: So  so that was the other thing . And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front - end .

Yeah .", "PhD D: And the dictionary made a huge difference . Uh .

Yeah .", "Professor B: Uh .  And .

Yeah .", "Professor B: so", "PhD D: Right .", "PhD F: W What is the performance on s the best Switchboard system that we 've done ?

{"meeting_id": "m_val_18", "domain": "committee", "meeting_transcripts": ["The Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 12th meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. This will be the first hybrid meeting of the committee. Some members will be participating via videoconference and some will be participating in person. This follows the order made by the House on May26,2020. Members who have already participated in a virtual meeting of the special committee may actually not notice any change, except for the fact that some members are also participating from the floor of the House. An additional rubric, that of statements by members, was also added to the proceedings of the committee. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up in the chamber on either side of the Speakers chair. Sound amplification for virtual interventions will be available, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor sound or interpretation using the earpieces on their desks. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. Please also direct your remarks through the Chair. Thank you. For those of you joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. If you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by videoconference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their microphone and state that they have a point of order. Those in the chamber can simply rise in the usual way. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Next we'll move on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we'll move on to petitions. We'll be presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificates off at the table once the petitions are presented. First on our list for presenting petitions is Ms. May, who is joining us virtually.", "Ms. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP): Mr. Chair, what an honour to be the first voice coming to you from the screens on either side of the Speaker of the House. I speak to you from SaanichGulf Islands on the traditional territory of the WSNEC people. Hych'ka Siem. I'm presenting a petition, number 431-00215, and it has been certified. The petitioners call on this House to take note of the fact that Canada is the only country with a universal health care system that does not include the provision of necessary prescription medications. They note that the system across Canada is a patchwork that leaves three million Canadians unprepared and uninsured to be able to purchase necessary medications. They call on the House assembled to put in place a system of universal national pharmacare, bringing down the cost of drugs through bulk purchasing. I think I'll call that a summary, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much.", "The Chair: The next petition will be presented by Mr. Genuis.", "Mr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I'm pleased to be presenting two petitions before the committee today. The first petition is in support of Bill S-204. This Senate public bill, been put forward by Senator Salma Ataullahjan in the Senate, would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad to receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It also has a mechanism by which somebody could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for being involved in the horrible practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill has been before various Parliaments for over 10 years, and petitioners are hopeful that this Parliament will be the one that finally takes action to address forced organ harvesting and trafficking. The second petition is put forward by folks who are concerned about Bill C-7, particularly the efforts by the government through Bill C-7 to remove vital safeguards that are currently associated with Canada's euthanasia regime. Petitioners are not happy about the fact that the government is trying to eliminate the 10-day reflection period and remove other safeguards that only four short years ago the government thought were essential for the euthanasia and assisted suicide system that they were putting in place. The petitioners call on the government to address that, and they are not supportive of these particular efforts to remove vital safeguards from that regime. Thank you very much.", "The Chair: Is anyone else presenting petitions? Seeing none, we'll move on to statements by members. We will now proceed to Statements by Members for a period not exceeding 15minutes. Each statement will be for one minute. The first will be from Mr.Samson. Mr.Samson, you have the floor.", "Mr. Darrell Samson (SackvillePrestonChezzetcook, Lib.): Good afternoon, everyone. It's an honour to be presenting an S. O. 31. This spring has been a difficult one for Nova Scotia and the communities of SackvillePrestonChezzetcook. While residents have banded together to tackle the challenges presented by COVID-19, we have also had to mourn the passing of three remarkable local women: RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, well known by many in Cole Harbour and the surrounding areas; our own Sub-Lieutenant Abbigail Cowbrough, who was based out of 12 Wing Shearwater; and Captain Jenn Casey of the Canadian Forces Snowbirds. All three women died in the line of duty in separate tragic events while serving our country. These three brave women, who served with honour on land, at sea and in the air, represent the absolute best of us. Heidi, Abbigail and Jenn were inspirational and will not be forgotten. Thank you.", "The Chair: Next we'll go to Mr. Bezan.", "Mr. James Bezan (SelkirkInterlakeEastman, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Canada needs a prime minister who will create jobs and opportunity, but instead we have a prime minister who is piling up crippling national debt. Yesterday the PBO predicted the federal deficit this year will hit over $252 billion. That is almost equivalent to an average year of government spending before the Liberal government. After five years with this debt, Prime Minister, Canada's national debt is set to hit $1 trillion, with almost nothing to show for it. Industries from coast to coast are either closed or are struggling. Canadian workers need and deserve a prime minister who supports our energy sector and gets our natural resources and agriculture products to market, who supports small business and will make our tax system encourage job creation and growth, and who will bring advanced manufacturing jobs to Canada and keep the automotive industry growing. Most importantly, we need a Conservative prime minister who will get the government finances under control after the massive debt left by this prime minister.", "The Chair: Next we'll go to Mr. Anandasangaree.", "Mr. Gary Anandasangaree (ScarboroughRouge Park, Lib.): Mr. Chair, I speak today with a very heavy heart. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, we've seen a disproportionate number of deaths in long-term care homes. I'm thankful for the Canadian Armed Forces who were deployed to the Altamont care home in my riding and four other facilities across the GTA. The CAF have brought forward horrifying allegations in the operation of these homes. They include residents being given expired or improper doses of medication; not being cleaned or changed for a prolonged period of time; being forcibly fed, causing choking; being bed-bound for weeks; receiving inadequate nutrition, and much more. Mr. Chair, I call upon Premier Ford to place these five homes under a mandatory management order and to appoint a third party manager to address and rectify these violations. I also call upon the Premier to undertake an independent public inquiry into the tragedy we face in long-term care facilities across Ontario. Finally, Mr. Chair, we need to work with the provinces and territories to set national standards of care for the most vulnerable in our society. We can and must do better. Thank you, Mr. Chair.", "The Chair: We have a point of order. Go ahead, Ms. May.", "Ms. Elizabeth May: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I hesitate to interrupt colleagues, but I'm concerned about the petition practice, which, as I understand it, is to summarize a petition but not make a speech. I felt one of our colleagues was trespassing on our usual rules.", "The Chair: I will remind honourable members that when a petition is presented, we're expected to give a prcis and make it as concise as possible. Thank you. Mr.Champoux, you have the floor.", "Mr. Martin Champoux (Drummond, BQ): Mr.Chair, I would like to recognize the resilience of Quebeckers concerned for their jobs or their businesses during the COVID-19 crisis. They need us to plan for after the crisis, and we must do so now. To do so, we need the proper information. We need to know the status of the public finances. That is why the Bloc Qubcois is demanding that the government present an economic update, and that it do so before June17. This is not about making a spectacle. Everyone knows that the deficit will be huge. We had to provide the people with support and we all agree on that. But we have to know to what extent. We also have to know where we are starting from so that we can plan where we are going. This is about respecting the public, because they are the ones who will be paying the bill. In closing, I would like to remind the government that one group is not really contributing to the public purse at the moment. I am talking about the tech giants, the GAFAM group, that have never before been used to the extent that they are now, and that are still not paying a cent in tax in Canada. The Liberals promised to correct this injustice. Now is a great time for them to do so.", "The Chair: We'll now go to Ms. Sidhu.", "Ms. Sonia Sidhu (Brampton South, Lib.): Mr. Chair, this week is National Paramedic Services Week. I want to take this opportunity to thank the Peel region police, paramedic and firefighting services for keeping Bramptonians safe. In my riding, organizations have stepped up to help our community. Organizations such as the Khalsa Aid Society, the Interfaith Council of Peel, the Brampton YMCA, the Prayer Stone Peoples Church, Unity in the Community, Ste. Louise Outreach Centre, Knights Table, the Yogi Divine Society, Vraj Community Service, Regeneration Brampton and many more have made our community stronger during this difficult time. I also have to address the report that came out yesterday from our brave Canadian Armed Forces. Like many Canadians, I was shocked by this report from the long-term care centres, including one in my riding. The examples of abuse described in the report are unacceptable. Our seniors deserve dignity and respect. We must find a solution. We need to fix this.", "The Chair: We'll now go to Mrs. Stubbs.", "Mrs. Shannon Stubbs (Lakeland, CPC): Mr. Chair, Canada's oil and gas sector is in crisis, made worse by five years of bad policies, red tape and barriers to pipelines. Just in the last two months, we saw the largest production cut in Canadian history. Active rigs dropped by 92% and tens of thousands of oil and gas workers lost their jobs, adding to the 200,000 since 2015. Energy is Canada's biggest investor, and exporting could lead the recovery if there are actions, not just words. On March 25, the finance minister promised help in hours or days, not weeks, but he's letting Canadians down. Sixty-three days later, small oil and gas companies still can't apply for BDC loans, and last week's large employer loan terms are predatory, with interest rates escalating to 14% by year five. Those are payday loan rates. The required stock options being at record lows could make the government the largest shareholder. That's not emergency assistance; it's pandemic profiteering. Programs can't help workers if businesses can't or won't actually get the support. The Liberals' death-by-delay tactics are doing exactly what foreign activists in other countries want: to shut down Canada's oil.", "The Chair: Ms.Bessette, the floor is yours.", "Mrs. Lyne Bessette (BromeMissisquoi, Lib.): Mr.Chair, in times of crisis, we stick together. I can state that this is certainly the case in BromeMissisquoi. In the last weeks, I have been calling volunteer action centres in my constituency so that they can tell me their news. I would like to take the time that I have to highlight the work that community organizations are doing tirelessly in my constituency. The crisis has made us realize the extent to which food banks and meals-on-wheels can not only relieve hunger, but also relieve thousands of shut-in seniors of their loneliness. Let me also highlight the devotion of the volunteers giving generously of their time, particularly the initiative of Mabel Hastings in the volunteer aid centre in Mansonville. Like me, she sends out a daily newsletter to keep the public informed about the many resources available for their support. COVID-19 is bringing out the best in our community and I am certain that, together, we will get through it.", "The Chair: We will go to Mr. Virani.", "Mr. Arif Virani (ParkdaleHigh Park, Lib.): Mr. Chair, during the COVID-19 pandemic I have been inspired by the courageous work of so many essential workers. I want to thank everyone on the front lines for keeping us safe, keeping us fed and keeping our communities functioning. I want to make special note of one particular essential health care worker, a woman who is a quarantine manager with the Public Health Agency of Canada. I have personally seen her working tirelessly over the past three months to keep all of us safe. That woman is my wife, Suchita Jain. Suchi, I love you, I am very proud of you and I thank you for all of the sacrifices you are making. I want to highlight another woman from my riding of ParkdaleHigh Park, Rachelle LeBlanc. She is a local designer. When the pandemic broke, she saw the need for protective barriers for small shops in Parkdale, so she set about collecting donations. She then put her design talents to work and started designing free-standing protective shields. Rachelle's team has now delivered 25 free COVID protective shields to small shopkeepers in Parkdale, and the team is on track to building 100 more. It's the compassion of Canadians like Rachelle that gives meaning to the phrase we are all in this together.", "The Chair: Mr.Godin, you have the floor.", "Mr. Jol Godin (PortneufJacques-Cartier, CPC): Mr.Chair, the school year has been shattered and our graduating classes must be proud of what they have achieved amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Young men, young women, be proud of your accomplishments! You can believe in the future. Keep learning. It will give you tools that will serve you all your lives. What you have achieved in this extraordinary year will set you apart from the others. I invite you to be inspired by that and turn it to your advantage. The current government has the obligation to promote the values that will lead you to become involved in your communities. Your willingness to learn or to work makes you into better citizens. Knowledge and experience are irreplaceable and invaluable. I implore this government, which is unaware of the damage it is causing, to immediately announce all the positions that have already been approved under the Canada summer jobs program. Urgent action is needed. Let us have confidence in our organizations, our companies, and let us support our youth, a rich resource that we must equip and motivate. I congratulate all the young graduates in the beautiful constituency of PortneufJacques-Cartier.", "The Chair: We will now go to Mr. Fergus.", "Mr. Greg Fergus (HullAylmer, Lib.): Mr.Chair, this pandemic lets us see what Canadians are made of. This coming Saturday, May30, more than 2,000Christians of all denominations are coming together virtually for prayer and for action. When the going gets tough, Canadians get going. This could not be more true than with respect to what will be happening on May 30. This Saturday, in more than 2,000 churches and homes, thousands of faith-filled Canadians are gathering to pray and act on those prayers as part of Stand United Canada. They will gather through television, Facebook Live and Instagram Live. Then they are going to deliver much-needed support to at-risk Canadians who live in disadvantaged areas. This is faith in action. I'm sure I speak for all parliamentarians when I wish success to Stand United Canada. I hope it inspires more Canadians to follow in its footsteps. Thank you, Mr. Chair.", "The Chair: We will now go to Ms. Harder.", "Ms. Rachael Harder (Lethbridge, CPC): The best way to safeguard the truth is to allow people to speak freely, but from the very beginning of this pandemic, the Liberals have silenced dissent. Sadly, their short-sightedness has been to the detriment of Canadians. Early on, they propagated the notion that human-to-human transmission wasn't possible. They said that closing the borders wasn't necessary. They told us that wearing face masks wouldn't help. It is undeniable that the Liberal government has put Canadians in danger by silencing alternative points of view and has spread misinformation. Ironically, however, they have now gone ahead and crowned themselves the arbiters of truth. They are spending millions of dollars to censor what Canadians can and cannot say. They are determining what is true and what is not, what is right and what is wrong, what is in and what is out. When freedom of speech is repressed, it is safe to say that democracy is under siege. I call upon the government to restore the personal liberties that are granted under our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This is Canada. We are not an autocracy; we are a democracy.", "The Chair: We will now go to Mr. Nater.", "Mr. John Nater (PerthWellington, CPC): Mr. Chair, small businesses have always been the cornerstone of communities across this country. They provide employment and economic stability and are always the first to support community functions and activities, but small businesses have been particularly hard hit due to COVID-19. They have shut their doors temporarily, and now many worry they'll never be able to open their doors again. With the season cancellations at the Stratford Festival, Drayton Entertainment and Stratford Summer Music, businesses in the tourism, hospitality, accommodation and retail sectors in PerthWellington are struggling. Every day, I talk to small business owners who can't access the Canada emergency business account, and others who find the convoluted commercial rent assistance program to be out of reach. The program is needlessly complicated, frustratingly slow and excessively restrictive. Mr. Chair, the government needs to go back, fix these programs and ensure that support goes to the small businesses that need it.", "The Chair: We will now go to Ms. Collins.", "Ms. Laurel Collins (Victoria, NDP): Mr. Chair, Canadians have been shaken by this pandemic. It has exposed the gaps in our health care system and our social safety net. It has shown how vulnerable we all are when disaster hits. It has brought us to a crossroads. We can go backwards to so-called business as usual, with horrific conditions in long-term care homes, widespread inequality and no real action on climate change, or we can build for better. In Victoria, people in the community, organizations and municipal leaders have been calling for a new way forward. The City of Victoria has a plan for reinvention, resilience and recovery. Organizations like Greater Victoria Acting Together; Common Vision, Common Action; and Kairos Victoria are exploring ideas for a sustainable and just recovery. We can build for better. We can invest in the infrastructure. We need to fight climate change, homelessness and inequality. We can build a Canada where we take better care of the planet and each other.", "The Chair: We now move to Ms.DeBellefeuille.", "Mrs. Claude DeBellefeuille (SalaberrySurot, BQ): Mr.Chair, in this time of pandemic, it is with heartfelt emotion that I want to highlight the excellent work of all the guardian angels at the CISSS de la Montrgie-Ouest. From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank the entire staff, as well as the retirees who have come back to provide their assistance. I admire the managers, at all levels and in all services, working tirelessly so that their teams can answer the call in this difficult situation. My fellow managers and the management teams of the Support Program for the Autonomy of Seniors, both in home support and in residential care, you have my heartfelt congratulations for the herculean work you have done. My thoughts go particularly to Lyne Ricard and Vronique Proulx, managers working diligently with their teams of professionals to support the seniors living in intermediate resources, as we call them. I also warmly recognize the director of nursing services, Chantal Careau, who is facing the current challenge with passion and humanity. Once again, my congratulations go to the entire organization of the CISSS de la Montrgie-Ouest for their remarkable work in this difficult and very demanding time.", "The Chair: We will go to Mr. Barlow.", "Mr. John Barlow (Foothills, CPC): During the worst of times, we see the best in people. Heroes are born, characters revealed, resiliency is sowed. I cannot say enough about my constituents in Foothillsfront-line health care workers, grocery store clerks, restaurateurs, farmersfor all they are doing to keep our community safe and healthy. I want to shine a light on some of our hidden heroes, such as Owen Plumb, a grade 9 student in Okotoks who is using his 3D printer to build PPE for front-line health care workers. He partnered with the Rotary Club and Evergreen Solutions in Okotoks to help with the manufacturing and assembly. There is also Sam Schofield, the volunteer president of the Pincher Creek Chamber of Commerce, overnight built a resiliency website for COVID-19 by building training tools for businesses throughout his area. He also helped develop the Foothills Business Recovery Taskforce, which is a resource for businesses throughout southern Alberta in my riding. Finally, to the employees of Cargill Foods in High River, I know this has been a very difficult time and that many of you have lost loved ones. I want to say thank you for tirelessly doing all you can to protect our food supply and keep food on our table. Each and every one of you is a hero. Thank you.  Some hon. members: Hear, hear!", "The Chair: We will now go to Mr. Simms.", "Mr. Scott Simms (Coast of BaysCentralNotre Dame, Lib.): Thank you, Chair. I would like to take this time to salute those who go above and beyond the call of duty to provide care and comfort to others. In my 16 years in the House of Commons I have never experienced anything like this, when we find our lives are at a standstill and there is so much sorrow felt by families who suffer from the effects of COVID-19. However, here are two examples of kindness right here in Newfoundland and Labrador. Shanna and Fred Patey of Bishop's Falls, along with a few of their friends, spend hours next to the Trans-Canada Highway with just a barbeque and a cooler. They serve free meals for truckers crossing our province each and every day. So far they have provided over 1,500 meals. There is also Mitch Strickland of Grand Falls-Windsor, who owns Appy's Diner. He has continually provided food for the local hospital and other front-line workers through his donations. To all our front-line workers in grocery stores and delivery trucks, and to doctors, nurses, LPNs, paramedics, first responders and, of course, our brave women and men in the military, we will be forever grateful and blessed because of you. Thank you.  Some hon. members: Hear, hear!", "The Chair: That's all the time we have today for Statements by Members. Before going on, I just want to remind all the members that it is a one-minute statement, so if you don't mind, please time it before coming in because we do have limited time. The other thing that has come up is that some of you just naturally speak very quickly. I'm not here to judge anybody's way of speaking, but try to consider the translators and interpreters to make sure that everyone understands what is said, because they are working diligently to try to get both languages out. In sum, there are two things: please slow down and please make sure the statement is confined to one minute. We now move to Questions to Ministers. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes in order to allow the employees who are providing support for the sitting to substitute for each other safely.  Our first question goes to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Scheer.", "Hon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. In the early days of the pandemic and the lockdown that followed, Canadians were told by this government that programs would be rolled out very quickly and that gaps and shortcomings would be changed as time went on. While many Canadians are being let down by this government's response and its unnecessarily rigid programs, Conservatives identified solutions weeks ago, yet here we are, two and a half months later, and many of these programs still have not been improved. I have a simple question for the Prime Minister. On April 26 the Conservatives asked the Prime Minister to change the criteria for the Canada emergency business account so that small businesses that don't happen to have a business bank account could qualify for those types of programs. It's now May 27. Is the Prime Minister going to make that change?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister): Mr. Chair, we knew from the beginning of this pandemic that we did need to move extremely quickly, and that's what we did. We rolled out the Canada emergency response benefit extremely quickly. Eight million Canadians have had that as a replacement for paycheques lost because of COVID-19. We also moved forward on the wage subsidy and a range of other programs to support workers and small businesses. What we've done in terms of helping small businesses with the Canada emergency business account has had a massive impact on small businesses across the country, but we understand that certain companies and businesses have particularities that mean it's a little more difficult for them to qualify. We are working with them through their regional development agencies, and we encourage them to approach their local RDAs, which will be able to help them get the money they deserve.", "Hon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, these are very simple technical fixes that can be made by this government. There's no excuse for the delay. It's May 27. They've known about these problems for weeks. They're trying to get patted on the back for actions they took back in March, and yet they are letting so many Canadians down by not making these very simple changes. For example, companies that have acquired another company in the last year have employees whose jobs are threatened. The businesses are not allowed to qualify for the wage subsidy because their revenue is now counted together. We have identified this gap. Again, it's a simple question. Will companies that have acquired another company still be allowed to use the wage subsidy to keep workers on the job, yes or no?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, I know that there are many different types of businesses across this country that need support. We have moved forward on supporting as many of them as we possibly can, and we continue to work on filling gaps. I know the member opposite has talked to me a number of times about a tractor company in his riding. I can assure you that finance officials are engaged with that company to see if there's a way to make sure we're getting them the support they need.", "Hon. Andrew Scheer: It's actually a very simple fix. I can save him and his officials a lot of time. The government used the word amalgamation when it announced the changes to that program. He can make this very clear, and save a lot of work, just by including the word acquisition. Will he do that?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, I can assure you that finance officials are working closely with Brandt Tractor. They're continuing to work with a range of businesses across the country that, for various reasons, are not able to apply for the help we have now. We will continue to work to make sure people who need the help get it.", "Hon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, it's literally one word. We can email him the text. We can send him the page in the dictionary where that word is defined, if that would help. Another gap that is letting people down is in the rent relief program. The government has set the parameters to qualify for the rent relief program for companies that have experienced a 70% revenue loss. There are untold thousands of businesses that have experienced a 50%, 55%, 60% or 65% loss that are ineligible but have no capacity to pay the rent. We called on the government weeks ago to have a more flexible sliding scale to allow more companies to access this program to keep more people on the job and more businesses open. Will the government introduce some flexibility to this program to help more businesses survive?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, from the beginning of this pandemic, our public servants and policy-makers have been moving creatively and quickly to try to get help to as many people as we possibly can, with our focus being on the people who need it the most. Obviously, this pandemic is affecting everyone and every business across the country in different ways, but our focus has been on ensuring that those who most need it are getting the help they can. We will, of course, continue to work with the parties opposite and all Canadians to ensure that we're getting help to everyone who needs it, but our focus has always been on the most vulnerable, first and foremost.", "The Chair: The floor now goes to Mr.Blanchet.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet (BeloeilChambly, BQ): Thank you, Mr.Chair. My question is for the Prime Minister. If the Liberal Party of Canada had not taken advantage of the emergency programs, would it have laid off all its staff?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we recognized that a number of organizations and companies were facing difficulties because of COVID-19. People work for those organizations, as accountants, receptionists, assistants or labourers, and those people need to be supported. We are supporting people all over the country through that program.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Is the Liberal Party one of those organizations in difficulty?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Any company or organization that can demonstrate a significant drop in its income, whether that be in donations, receipts, profits", "The Chair: The floor goes to Mr.Blanchet.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Is the Liberal Party of Canada in difficulty, as an organization?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we created specific criteria to help organizations in difficulty. Any organization experiencing those difficulties can apply.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: In the Magdalen Islands, fishing companies in difficulty and in need of assistance will not have the money that the Liberals are going to take. Is the Liberal Party of Canada in difficulty, as an organization?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we have invested in assistance for fishers all across the country. We recognize that it is a difficult situation because of COVID-19. We will be here for our fishers and for industries in difficulty.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: I am not catching many answers, it seems to me. A company in Drummondville that manufactures isolation membranes is in difficulty because a federal program is inadequate. Compared to that company, is the Liberal Party of Canada in difficulty, as an organization?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, there are clear criteria for submitting applications under these programs. Companies and organizations that receive money qualify for those programs.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: If the program criteria establish that the Liberal Party is an organization in difficulty, does that mean that the criteria to determine whether an organization is in difficulty are poorly designed?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, all through this pandemic, our priority has been to be here for workers in difficulty so that they do not lose their jobs. This applies to all organizations and companies in the country to the extent possible. That is what we are in the process of doing.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Given the answers from the Prime Minister, let me ask this question: is the Prime Minister in difficulty?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: No, Mr.Chair. We are doing important work for all Canadians, every day.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Restaurant owners on rue Ontario in Montreal feel that they will not make it through the crisis and that they will never open their doors again. They are in difficulty. By comparison, is the Liberal Party of Canada an organization in difficulty that will not open its doors again after the crisis? We can but hope.", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we established criteria for that program in order to help those working for various organizations. Any organization that receives the subsidy has qualified for it.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Is there a consensus in the Liberal Party caucus that the Liberal Party is in difficulty as an organization?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we are working every day to help Canadians and workers in difficulty. We are going to continue to do that work.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Does answering a question put the Prime Minister in difficulty?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, it is a pleasure to be here in the House and to answer questions from Canadians and from members of the opposition.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: You are going to answer a question from a Quebecker, I hope. Companies are struggling in Saguenay, in the Gasp, in Beloeil. Would those companies not deserve to be saved by the money that the supposedly struggling Liberal Party has taken?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: I am always very happy to answer questions from all Canadians currently sitting in the House. We will be here to help workers in difficulty all across the country, including in Quebec.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: If the Prime Minister is so happy to answer questions, I hope he will be delirious with joy to answer this one. Is the Liberal Party in difficulty?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, we established a program to help those working in organizations and who could lose their jobs because of COVID-19. We are here to help workers in organizations and companies all over the country.", "The Chair: We'll now go on to Mr. Singh.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh (Burnaby South, NDP): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. The conditions of seniors as outlined by the military were appalling, but seniors need more than just compassionate words. They need action. Will the Prime Minister stop hiding behind excuses and actually show leadership to fix long-term care?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, the Constitution of Canada is not an excuse. It lays out the divisions of powers and responsibilities, and we respect the provinces' jurisdiction over long-term care facilities. However, from the very beginning, we have indicated our willingness to support the provinces on this very important issue. We need to make sure our seniors right across the country are properly cared for, which is why we sent in the military and why we are there to help the provinces.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: The former federal health minister, Dr. Philpott, said, We need to stop using jurisdiction as an excuse to not have federal leadership. That is a former federal health minister. Now, we know from the military report that staff were afraid to use vital equipment because of the cost. Will the Prime Minister call for an end to profit in long-term care?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, over the past couple of days I've had very good conversations with the premiers of both Quebec and Ontario on this important issue. I look forward to discussing issues around long-term care with all the premiers of the provinces and territories tomorrow evening as well. This is something that Canadians have seen needs concerted action. We will be there to support the provinces.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Needles were reused and expired medication was used, according to military reports. Will the Prime Minister call for an end to profit in the care of our seniors?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, the contents of that report were deeply disturbing and troubling for all Canadians. That is why we are committed to working with the provinces to fix this situation. Ontarians and indeed people right across the country are deeply preoccupied by what they've seen going on. We need to fix this, and we will do that together.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: The military report found that cockroaches and flies were present and that food was rotten. Will the Prime Minister call for national standards so that long-term care is governed by the same principles as the Canada Health Act?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, our priority right now is ensuring that we are supporting the provinces in their need to make sure that all seniors are protected right across the country in all those institutions. Going forward, we absolutely will need to have more conversations about how we can ensure that every senior across the country is properly supported.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: The military report found that respecting the dignity of patients was not a priority. Will the Prime Minister call for national standards and for long-term care to be governed by the same principles as the Canada Health Act?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, all Canadians know we need to do better by our seniors. This is something we all take very seriously, and all orders of government will work together to make sure that right now, and going forward, we improve our systems. The federal government will be there to work with the provinces on making that happen.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, the Prime Minister has said that he's willing to work with the provinces. I'm saying that we need to see federal leadership. We need a commitment at the federal level that the Prime Minister will push for things that people need, which is to remove profit from long-term care and to establish national standards. Will the Prime Minister go beyond working with provinces and show some leadership?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, I will always be here to stand up for Canadians in all different situations. We are going to work with the provinces, fully respecting jurisdictions, to make sure that, all across the country, Canadians in long-term care are supported as required and receive the services and the care they deserve.", "The Chair: Mr. Singh, we have 30 seconds. Ask a brief question, please.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Thank you very much. The COVID-19 crisis should not be used as an excuse to avoid presenting solutions to the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls committee, in particular by delaying action on the calls for justice. This is the same government that would not recognize it as a genocide, the same government that delayed the United Nations declaration legislation and the same government that is still taking indigenous kids to court. Will this government commit to core funding for indigenous services to help women and girls and ensure that the calls for justice are implemented without delay?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, we continue to work very closely with partners on the calls for justice even as we act in many areas, including better funding for shelters and for victims of domestic violence. We will continue to work with those partners, but people will understand that many of those partners are very focused right now on helping front-line workers, not on establishing the report. We will continue to work with them on the report, but the COVID-19 situation has made that more difficult.", "The Chair: I want to thank the honourable members who are shouting time, but I do have a timer here, and I am taking care of it. I appreciate the help, but I do want to remind them that I have the proper machinery here. We will now go to Mr. Bezan.", "Mr. James Bezan: Thank you, Chair. My question is to the Prime Minister. He was just talking about the tragic conditions in long-term care facilities in Ontario, and there was a report out from Quebec today. I want to commend the Canadian Armed Forces for witnessing these appalling conditions, putting it in the context of a report, and providing care to our loved ones in these long-term care facilities. The government is saying they didn't receive the report from the department until May 22, but this report came out on May 14. What happened to that report for eight days?", "The Chair: We will go to the honourable minister. We seem to have a technical issue, Mr. Sajjan. We can't hear you. You might want to put down your bar and keep it down while you're speaking.", "Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan (Minister of National Defence): Mr. Chair, I want to thank our Canadian Armed Forces members for the tremendous work they are doing. They did their duty, noted down their observations and reported them. While those observations were being reported directly to the managers, a report was being compiled. This report was given to me on the 21st. I then forwarded it to the Minister of Public Safety on the 22nd, and that report was then given to the provincial authorities very quickly afterwards.", "Mr. James Bezan: I trust that you got the report on the 21st, but the report was written on the 14th, so what happened with that report for seven days? Why wasn't it acted upon? Could you just explain that? Our loved ones were at risk during that entire time.", "Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan: Mr. Chair, as we stated, this report was done and given up through the chain of command, and the appropriate leadership did their due diligence. Once we received this report, it was forwarded to the appropriate authorities. Again, I want to commend our Canadian Armed Forces members for not only the tremendous work they are doing but also for doing their duty.", "Mr. James Bezan: That report from Ontario documented appalling conditions, horrific care that was being given to the clients, and also the way that the staff conducted themselves. We know that there are 39 members of the Canadian Armed Forces currently infected with COVID-19. Minister, do you believe that the infection could have been transmitted from staff to our soldiers serving in long-term care facilities because proper protocols were not being followed?", "Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan: Mr. Chair, when it comes to any type of activities that we send our Canadian Armed Forces on, we do our due diligence to make sure that we have the right protocols in place and the appropriate training. This is why we have taken the time to make sure our folks not only did the appropriate training but had the appropriate equipment. We have the right protocols in place, and we will make sure that our members who are infected by COVID will get the appropriate treatment as well.", "Mr. James Bezan: Does the Minister of National Defence believe that our soldiers serving in Operation Laser, who have put themselves in harm's way in battling the COVID virus as a war, deserve to have hazard pay benefits?", "Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan: Mr. Chair, when it comes to looking after Canadian Armed Forces personnel, yes, we are actually in the process as we speak of making sure that our members have the appropriate hazard pay. This is currently being drafted, and we will have more to say on this shortly.", "Mr. James Bezan: I hope that means it's a yes. I do encourage the government to provide that compensation to our soldiers and troops serving in Operation Laser. I would finally like to come back to the issue of the timeline from May 14 to May 21, when that report was in the department for one week. Under our parliamentary system, ministers are accountable for the conduct of their departments. Will the minister take responsibility for that report sitting on someone's desk for seven days and not being turned over to the proper authorities?", "Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan: Mr. Chair, I want to make it very clear: When it comes to the observations that were made, those were immediately reported to the appropriate management of the care facilities and to the appropriate links within the province. At the same time, this report was being compiled and pushed up to the chain of command, and they did their due diligence. As I stated, it was given to us, and on the same day it was forwarded to the Minister of Public Safety, who immediately then sent it to the provincial authorities.", "Mr. James Bezan: Was one of those authorities that this was sent to the RCMP?", "Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan: Mr. Chair, as stated, this will not only be given to the proper authorities but the appropriate steps will be taken now.", "The Chair: We'll now go to Ms. Falk. Ms. Falk.", "Mrs. Rosemarie Falk (BattlefordsLloydminster, CPC): Thank you, Chair. Yesterday it was revealed that the Minister of Digital Government has been promoting a fundraising campaign to sue Global News for their story criticizing the Chinese Communist Party. Why is the minister using her authority to support the Communist Party of China and threatening our media and freedom of expression?", "Hon. Joyce Murray (Minister of Digital Government): Mr. Chair, we value the important work of media right across the country. Attacking the integrity of hard-working journalists is simply not acceptable. Like many members on all sides of the House.... WeChat is a social media platform used to engage and share information with", "The Chair: Now we'll go back to Ms. Falk. Ms. Falk.", "Mrs. Rosemarie Falk: Is the minister aware of the efforts that the United Front carries out on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party to influence how Canadians view the People's Republic of China?", "Hon. Joyce Murray: Thank you for that question. Mr. Chair, I want to just be clear. The participation in the WeChat group, much like Facebook, is guided by posted", "The Chair: We'll now go back to Ms. Falk.", "Mrs. Rosemarie Falk: Is the minister an active participant in the efforts by the Communists to muzzle a Canadian journalist and deprive Canadians of the facts about China?", "Hon. Joyce Murray: Muzzling journalists is never acceptable, and our government is very clear on that. I will say that the individual in question posted something outside of the guidelines of my WeChat group and is no longer", "The Chair: We'll now go back to Ms. Falk. Ms. Falk, I just want to point out that we do have interpreters listening and trying to interpret. They'd appreciate it....", "Mrs. Rosemarie Falk: My questions are short. That's probably what it is.", "The Chair: Take a deep breath.", "Mrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, the Liberals can't shrug this off. The minister admitted to theBreaker that her own political staff manages this WeChat. This is someone who is paid by Canadian taxpayers. Why is the minister using tax dollars to help China attack Global News and freedom of expression?", "Hon. Joyce Murray: I think the member knows very well that the people who post on WeChat are free to post what they choose within certain guidelines. Those guidelines were ignored. That person is no longer part of my WeChat group. The post was completely unacceptable, and I do not share the views of the individual.", "Mrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, Sam Cooper is an investigative Canadian journalist who has uncovered many different criminal rackets that can be linked back to Beijing. Has the minister apologized to Sam Cooper for attempting to shut down his work?", "Hon. Joyce Murray: As we all know, community outreach is a very important part of the work of a member of Parliament. WeChat is one of many social media sites regularly used by members", "The Chair: We go back to Ms. Falk.", "Mrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, when will the minister apologize to Sam Cooper and Global News?", "Hon. Joyce Murray: Mr. Chair, I have been very clear that I do not share the views of the person who posted on my WeChat site, who operated outside of my", "The Chair: We'll now go back to Ms. Falk.", "Mrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, in December 2018 the Liberals passed Bill C-76. This included provisions to prevent foreign interference in Canadian society. Does the government believe that Joyce Murray's actions have violated this portion of the act?", "Hon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness): Mr. Chair, I want to assure the member that we are always vigilant in any foreign interference in our national security or issues of political interference in our society. It's monitored carefully by the national security establishment, according to the law as it exists in this country, and we will remain vigilant.", "Mrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, in May 2019, the Liberals launched their digital charter. One of the principles was strong democracy, a commitment to defend freedom of expression. Will the Liberals hold Joyce Murray's WeChat accountable if it has violated this part of the charter?", "Hon. Bill Blair: Mr. Chair, we are absolutely committed to the rule of law and will always uphold it. I think, as the minister has made very clear, she was not involved in this process and has no control over the individual who posted that matter.", "Mrs. Rosemarie Falk: Chair, unfortunately I don't believe that was a sufficient answer. This is really a yes or no. Will the government hold Joyce Murray's WeChat accountable if it has violated their part of the charter?", "Hon. Bill Blair: Again, Mr. Chair, I want to assure the member that our government remains committed to the rule of law and we will always work tirelessly to uphold the laws of this country.", "Mrs. Rosemarie Falk: Is that a yes or a no?", "Hon. Bill Blair: Again, I think it was very clear. We will always uphold the laws of Canada.", "Mrs. Rosemarie Falk: Still, was that a yes or a no? I'm not hearing a yes or a no.", "Hon. Bill Blair: I am doing my very best, Mr. Chair, to answer the question for the House and to assure the member opposite that our government will always remain committed to the rule of law. That is unequivocal.", "The Chair: We will now move on to the honourable member. The floor is yours, Mr.Deltell.", "Mr. Grard Deltell (Louis-Saint-Laurent, CPC): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I am very happy and proud to be participating in this discussion in the House of Commons today. My question is very simple: how much is Canada's deficit?", "Hon. Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance): Mr.Chair, we continue to be transparent with our measures. Of course, we want to make sure that our investments, our economy", "The Chair: The floor is yours, Mr.Deltell.", "Mr. Grard Deltell: Let me ask my question to the honourable Minister of Finance once more, since he is talking about transparency. My question is really simple: how much is Canada's deficit?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, our economic situation is very fluid. We have made major investments and we are making sure that our economy is working.", "Mr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, the minister's answer is not fluid at all. But the question is really simple: how much is Canada's deficit?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, it is important to be transparent with our investments. We look at the investments and the figures every day.", "Mr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, the Minister of Finance may not know what the deficit is, but one great Canadian does know. And he knows that he knows. Could the Minister of Finance be very clear, very fluid and, above all, very transparent with Canadians? What is Canada's deficit?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I want to be very clear with Canadians: our economic situation is very difficult. The situation is fluid. We are making investments to ensure that our economy will be strong in the future.", "Mr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, with all due respect to the Minister of Finance, let me point out that, though he is not very clear, Canada's Parliamentary Budget Officer was clear yesterday. The deficit is $260billion. That is the real number. Why does the government not have the courage to state it clearly, as the Parliamentary Budget Officer did yesterday?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we always want to be clear and transparent. It is very important for the situation to be stable in order to ensure our future. That is our economic approach. We are making investments now so that the situation becomes more stable.", "Mr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, I know that the Minister of Finance is very good with figures. But he is not able to give us one. Perhaps he could comment on the statement that the Parliamentary Budget Officer made yesterday, that the emergency assistance must have an end date, and if it does not, we are heading to levels of taxation that have not been seen in this country for generations. What is the government going to do to make sure that Canadians will not be overtaxed after this crisis?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we think it's very important to make investments. That way, we will have a resilient economy in the future. That's very important. That way, we know that we'll have a good economy in the future. When we have more information, we will", "The Chair: Mr.Deltell, you have the floor.", "Mr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, will the minister commit not to raise taxes after the crisis?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I have said several times that we do not have a plan to raise taxes. That's very important.", "Mr. Grard Deltell: Finally a clear answer! However, I'm not convinced that he will apply it. In fact, the Parliamentary Budget Officer himself has said that there isn't much ammunition left without shifting into a large structural deficit, which can lead directly to tax increases. If the Minister of Finance can't even say today what the deficit is today, how can he be credible when he says that he won't raise taxes?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I think what's most important is that during this pandemic, Canadians and companies across the country need the Government of Canada's help. That is our approach. That way, we will have an economy that will function in the future. Of course, this is important for future generations.", "Mr. Grard Deltell: When will there be an economic update?", "Mr. Grard Deltell: Mr.Chair, all observers are expecting an economic update to know where we're going. When will that happen?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we want our economic update to be accurate. That's why we are looking at information that allow us to make good forecasts.", "The Chair: We'll now go to Mr. Hoback.", "Mr. Randy Hoback (Prince Albert, CPC): Mr. Chair, the United States, Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Vietnam have created an economic prosperity group to diversify some of their key supply chains away from China. Canada has a free trade agreement with six of these seven countries. Why are we not part of this group?", "Hon. Mary Ng (Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade): Mr. Chair, I thank the hon. member for that question. Indeed, we have been working diligently with all of these countries to make sure that we are keeping global supply chains open during this critical time. I think everyone agrees that keeping supply chains open for medical goods, critical agriculture and essential goods is absolutely essential and", "The Chair: We'll go back to Mr. Hoback.", "Mr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, this government is refusing to come to terms with what COVID-19 will mean for the future of international trade. Why is Canada not at the table with our largest trading partner protecting the viability of our international supply chains and capitalizing on the opportunities of others doing the same?", "The Chair: Before we go to the minister, one of the members has his mike still on, and I would ask that he turn it off. I am hearing background noise. The hon. minister.", "Hon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, Canada has unprecedented access to a number of markets around the world because of the extraordinary agreements that we have made to provide access to customers in those international markets. During COVID-19, we have been working with our G20 partners. I have had two meetings with G20 trade ministers on the importance of keeping supply chains", "The Chair: We'll go back to Mr. Hoback.", "Mr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, is this payback for the Prime Minister snubbing these countries at the original TPP signing?", "Hon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, we have a CPTPP arrangement with these countries, and we are looking forward to making sure that we get Canadian businesses growing into those markets.", "Mr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, the U.K. will begin applying tariffs at the beginning of next year on Canadian exports such as seafood, beef and cars. These are the items that have had tariffs removed under CETA. Will the government commit to having a new trade agreement with the U.K. in place by January 1?", "Hon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, we are monitoring the situation very carefully. The U.K., of course, is a very important trading partner for Canada. They are in discussions right now. I want to assure Canadian businesses that CETA continues to apply to our trade with the U.K. during this period while they go through Brexit.", "Mr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, after CUSMA, this government guaranteed to the trade committee that they would publish the objectives of any new trade agreement. When will we see these objectives published and actually have a chance to view them?", "Hon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, we look forward to working to ensure that those objectives are published as we get into future trade discussions.", "Mr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, the resignation of the WTO director-general at this unprecedented time is concerning for the international trade community. Is the government committed to supporting a DG candidate who is dedicated to the massive reforms needed to get the WTO functioning again?", "Hon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, I want to thank the hon. member for that good question. The Ottawa group, led by Canada, is working with like-minded countries on the reform of the WTO. We've been doing this work and we continue to do this work. I look forward to making sure that we are leading the way on those discussions with like-minded", "The Chair: Mr. Hoback.", "Mr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, last week the President of the United States considered blocking cattle imports. Our beef producers don't need this. They need stability. Three-quarters of Canada's beef cattle exports go to the U.S. Has the government sought out and received assurances from the United States that no such action will apply to Canadian cattle?", "Hon. Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs): Mr. Chair, we have an excellent assurance of our trade with the United States, which is our new NAFTA trade agreement that we have negotiated, thanks to the unprecedented co-operation across this country. It is very important to the Canadian economy and Canadian producers.", "Mr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, going forward post-COVID, there are a lot things that will be changing in supply chains. What is this government doing proactively to look at opportunities in these supply chains that Canadian businesses can take advantage of?", "Hon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, we continue to work with countries around the globe to ensure that Canada's supply chains and those global supply chains, particularly for essential goods, for agricultural products, for medical supplies, continue to remain open. We will keep doing this work.", "Mr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, on the agriculture side, canola farmers would like to know the status of canola going into China. Can she update the House on that status?", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food): Mr.Chair, I want to assure my colleague that we are continuing to work with our industry representatives, our allies and our trading partners in China.", "The Chair: We'll now go to Ms. McLeod.", "Mrs. Cathy McLeod (KamloopsThompsonCariboo, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Senior Canadian bureaucrats received very credible reports in early January that China was procuring and hoarding PPE. As a member of cabinet, was the health minister aware?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health): Mr. Chair, from the very beginning of the outbreak in early January we were aware of the challenges our health sector would face, and we immediately began to work with the provinces and territories to understand what the need would be and how we could best prepare.", "Mrs. Cathy McLeod: In April, the minister stated there were not enough supplies in the national emergency stockpile. Can she explain why she approved a donation of 16 tonnes of PPE for China on January 31, claiming it would not compromise our supply? She can't have it both ways. We don't have enough; we have enough and it won't compromise it.", "Hon. Anita Anand (Minister of Public Services and Procurement): Mr. Chair, we are operating in a highly competitive global environment, and the reality is that we need to make sure we have multiple complementary supply chains operating at the same time, which we have been doing in the past weeks and months, to ensure our front-line health care workers have the supplies they need to keep Canadians safe. That's our priority. That's what we're working on.", "Mrs. Cathy McLeod: Unfortunately, this question was directed to the health minister, referencing things she actually stated in terms of the availability of our supplies. Before the she signed off on the donationand it was the health minister who signed off on the donationdid she consult with the health ministers in the provinces and territories?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, as the member opposite knows, provinces and territories have their own stockpiles, which of course they use to prepare for incidences of outbreak and other illnesses across their jurisdictions. We've worked very closely with the provinces and territories since the beginning of the outbreak to make sure we can provide any particular additional support. In fact, of all the requests made so far, we have been able to complete them.", "Mrs. Cathy McLeod: Health care workers are now having to look at modified full-face snorkels as an alternative to N95 masks. Did it not occur to the minister that our hospitals and care homes could have used that PPE she shipped out, providing a longer opportunity for them to also get procurement done?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, as the member opposite knows, the equipment that was donated when China was in its outbreak was an important donation of nearly expired or expired goods that it was in desperate need of in its effort to try to contain the virus. As the member opposite knows, we've been able to work successfully with provinces and territories to ensure they have what they need.", "Mrs. Cathy McLeod: Mr. Chair, I would suggest that during February and March our hospitals would have consumed that almost-expired product very efficiently, but I want to move on to another topic. When defending the sale of 22 seniors' homes to the Chinese government, the Prime Minister stated that we have a strong regulatory regime that imposes rigorous standards. He said that this regime ensures the care our seniors get is top quality. That was in 2017. Now he states he is saddened, shocked, disappointed and angered. Was the Prime Minister completely oblivious to the risks, or was he just too anxious to please the Chinese government when he sold those 22 homes?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, the homes the member opposite is referring to are in the province of B.C., and I have to commend the province for the early work it did to protect seniors in those long-term care homes. The member opposite is trying to confuse the issue. As she knows, the review we did was entirely separate from the standards to which the province holds the care homes.", "Mrs. Cathy McLeod: The Prime Minister does not have authority over seniors' homes, which he has clearly stated, but he does have authority over the act in which he approved the sale. At 18 months, government had an obligation to make sure there was compliance. Was that done?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, the long-term care homes in each province fall within the jurisdiction of their own particular act, and those provinces and territories are responsible for fulfilling the inspections required under that act.", "Mrs. Cathy McLeod: Under the Investment Canada Act, the government is obligated to review the sale for compliance. Four homes had to close. Since the government approved the sale, it is complicit in the care of our seniors in this country", "Hon. Navdeep Bains (Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry): Mr. Chair, I want to make it very clear that we understand how difficult this is for seniors. That is why we follow the appropriate steps, outlined under the Investment Canada Act, to make sure that any measures we take keep seniors and their well-being first and foremost.", "The Chair: Mr.Therrien, you now have the floor.", "Mr. Alain Therrien (La Prairie, BQ): Mr.Chair, during the pandemic, the government has given money to companies that don't pay a cent in tax because they use tax havens. We told the government that it didn't make sense. The government's response was that it is no big deal. During the pandemic, the government gave money to Air Canada, but Air Canada never reimbursed customers who did not get the services they paid for. We told the government that it did not make sense. The government's response was that it was no big deal. During the pandemic, the Liberal Party used the emergency wage subsidy to fund partisan activities. We told them that it did not make sense. The government responded that it was no big deal. Is the moral of the story that the government thinks that dipping into the pockets of taxpayers to spend money carelessly is no big deal?", "Hon. Diane Lebouthillier (Minister of National Revenue): Mr.Chair, the fight against tax evasion is a priority for our government. We will continue to target companies that use tax evasion schemes. Let me be clear: in everything we do, we will target companies and not innocent workers. Employees are employees, no matter who they work for.", "Mr. Alain Therrien: Mr.Chair, when I see that it's the Minister of National Revenue answering me, I don't feel like buying a lottery ticket. The Liberal Party used two airplanes in its last election campaign, which seems to indicate that it isn't short of money. However, the Liberals used the emergency wage subsidy. Why? Is it because they want taxpayers to fund a third airplane?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we think it's very important to protect employees across the country and in every economic sector that's experiencing a significant drop in income. That's the approach we've taken to protect people and to ensure that there will be jobs in the future. We will continue this approach.", "Mr. Alain Therrien: It's especially important to protect the employees who work for the Liberals to ensure their re-election, yet the Liberal Party has raised more than $7million since the last election. Is the party in jeopardy? Can it go bankrupt?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, as I said, our approach is to protect employees. We think that this principle is very important and that this approach must be maintained in order to have a better job market in the future.", "Mr. Alain Therrien: Mr.Chair, we still don't know exactly how much money the Liberals took from the cookie jar. We think they may have taken as much as $1million. How many SMEs could have been saved with the $1million that the Liberals took out of the jar and took away from SMEs?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we appreciate the question. We are protecting hundreds of thousands of SMEs through the emergency wage subsidy, the Canada emergency response benefit and all our programs. We will continue this approach to help SMEs and their employees.", "Mr. Alain Therrien: Mr.Chair, I will propose a choice of answers, or I won't get any. When did the government decide to use the emergency wage subsidy? Now here are three possible answers. The first possible answer is that when the Liberals brought in the emergency wage subsidy, they set parameters allowing them to use it. The second is that when the Liberals saw the Conservative Partywhich is as rich as they are, but also sanctimonious and self-righteoustake advantage of the subsidy, they thought they could do it too. The third possible answer is that the Liberals hadn't planned to use the subsidy, but they pounced on the cookie jar when they saw it, because that's what they do.", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we continue to think it is very important to protect employees in every sector of the economy and across Canada. That's our approach, and I believe it's the right one to protect and preserve jobs across the country during a pandemic.", "The Chair: We are now going to suspend the proceedings for a few seconds to allow the employees who provide support for the meeting to replace each other safely.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton (Simcoe North, CPC)): We will now resume the discussion.  We'll continue with Ms. Khalid, the honourable member for MississaugaErin Mills.", "Ms. Iqra Khalid (MississaugaErin Mills, Lib.): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll be splitting my time with the member for PickeringUxbridge. Mr. Chair, when the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces stepped in to provide support to five long-term care homes in Ontario at the request of the premier, they released a report that outlined their findings in detail. Military members witnessed residents' cries for help going unanswered. They saw force-feeding. They saw bug infestations, a lack of personal protective equipment and neglect. Canadians are shaken. They are appalled by the horrific conditions outlined in the military report. Almost 1,000 seniors so far have lost their lives in long-term care homes in Ontario alone, over 25 of them in my riding of MississaugaErin Mills. These deaths could have been prevented. Can the Minister of Health please update the House on how our federal government is working with the provinces and territories to prevent further tragic occurrences from happening at long-term care homes and to ensure that our most vulnerable seniors are properly looked after and cared for?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, it's such an important question. I believe all Canadians were deeply horrified to read the details from the Canadian Armed Forces on the conditions in long-term care homes in Ontario. What's happening to seniors in Ontario is completely unacceptable. The report is very troubling. Seniors deserve to live with dignity, with respect and with safety. While long-term care is provincially regulated, we know that we need to work together. The Government of Canada stands ready to support provinces and territories as they continue to respond to this crisis. I had a very good conversation with my provincial and territorial counterparts last night about the work we can do at a national level to support their important work. We also know that seniors want to stay at home longer. That's why our historic investment of $6 billion in home care was so important. We'll continue to work with the provinces and territories to ensure that they get the care and dignity they deserve.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go now to Ms. O'Connell.", "Ms. Jennifer O'Connell (PickeringUxbridge, Lib.): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I will sadly report that my community of Pickering has experienced the largest number of deaths at a single COVID-19 outbreak location anywhere in this country. Seventy residents at Orchard Villa long-term care home died during this pandemic. It was a devastating blow to our community. Yesterday, we received the horrific report from the Canadian Armed Forces detailing what they witnessed at Orchard Villa in Pickering, Altamont Care Community in Scarborough, Eatonville Care Centre in Etobicoke, Hawthorne Place in North York, and Holland Christian Homes' Grace Manor in Brampton. The loved ones of those who have passed away, as well as the homes' workers, have asked for a full public inquiry from the Ontario government. I know that the responsibility for these facilities falls within provincial jurisdiction, but on behalf of our communities, can the Minister of Health update us on the work she is doing to ensure that the Ontario government takes action immediately and initiates a full, independent, non-partisan public inquiry and reverses its decision to create a government-led commission that won't even start until September?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I would say that all Canadians were shocked and horrified to hear about the conditions that existed in these particular care homes. We're so grateful to the members of the armed forces who not only improved conditions but also reported them quickly and appropriately to ensure amelioration of those conditions for those particular individuals. We also know that there are seniors all across the country who are struggling with care and with the appropriate level of care. We have to do better as a country. These are our loved ones. These are our parents and our grandparents. These are the people in our lives who have given so much to us. I stand committed to working with my provincial and territorial counterparts to ensure that we do better as a society. We know that there's a role we can play at the federal level with advice, with guidance, with support and, yes, with investments. We look forward to having those conversations about how best we can improve the care for all seniors amongst us.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go now to Mr. Davies from Vancouver Kingsway.", "Mr. Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway, NDP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Canadians were horrified to hear the report yesterday from our armed forces about the appalling conditions experienced by seniors in our long-term care homes. Page after page detailed the filth, neglect, abuse and danger our seniors in care are exposed to on a daily basis. Shockingly they face injury and death through missed medications, expired medications, unsterile devices and violations of basic contagion rules to stop the spread of COVID-19. Given that evidence of possible criminal conduct was contained in the military's report, will the minister refer this matter to the RCMP for investigation immediately?", "Hon. Bill Blair: Mr. Chair, thanks very much to the member for those expressions of concern, which we share. We understand in long-term care facilities both seniors and persons living with a disability face unique challenges, and the findings of this report are in fact deeply concerning and completely unacceptable. Considering the severity of this report, we promptly shared it with the Province of Ontario, and the Province of Ontario has initiated an investigation based on the report's findings. Their investigation includes alerting the province's chief coroner who has the authority to alert the police of jurisdiction. We will continue to work with the province to protect those living in long-term care facilities, and we continue to support them through the deployment of our outstanding Canadian Armed Forces and in our partnership with the Red Cross.", "Mr. Don Davies: Mr. Chair, that's a shocking answer considering there's clear evidence of criminal conduct and negligence in this. That this federal government is not taking immediate steps to refer this to the nation's RCMP is unacceptable. The seniors care crisis is a national problem. COVID-19 has exposed critical vulnerabilities across Canada's entire network of long-term care facilities. Not a single province or territory currently meets the benchmark of 4.1 hours of hands-on care per day. As a result Canada has the worst record of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care among 14 comparable countries, with over 80% of Canadian fatalities occurring in these facilities. Will this government move swiftly to establish binding national standards for long-term care?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, the member opposite is exactly correct when he says that those who are hardest hit in terms of losing their lives and the negative effects of COVID are those who are living in long-term care homes. He's also correct when he indicates that COVID-19 has shown us what many of us have known for a long time, that we need to do better in long-term care and supports for seniors. As the member knows, we started those steps some four years ago or so when we began to make incredible investments in aging at home. We know that is one part of the solution, but we have to do better for those seniors who need a higher level of care. That's the work I'm doing now. I'm working with my colleagues at the provinces and territories to make sure that we come up with a solution that will truly result in better standards for all.", "Mr. Don Davies: Mr. Chair, what we need is binding national standards, just like we set through the Canada Health Act in the health care sector generally. Gross fecal contamination, filthy medical equipment, insect infestations, ignoring patient cries for hourswe would never tolerate these conditions in Canada's hospitals. There's no reason to accept them in Canada's long-term care facilities. Will the minister move to bring long-term care facilities under the Canada Health Act, or similar legislation, with formal funds tied to acceptable standards of care for our seniors, just like we do for hospitals?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, the member shares the disgust and concern of so many Canadians across the country, not only those who have read the report but many of those who have struggled to provide care to elders in those long-term care homes, regardless of the province in which they live. We know we need to do better. We know that collectively, at all levels of government, we must do better for those people who cared for us and nurtured us all of those years. The member has my commitment that I will work with provinces and territories to find a solution forward to ensure that every person has the right to age with dignity and safety.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr. Davies, you have 15 seconds for another question, a short one, and leave time for a response.", "Mr. Don Davies: Thank you, Mr. Chair. These failures are the product of systemic neglect often motivated by prioritizing profit over the provision of adequate care. Does the minister agree that we should not be putting profits above the health care needs of Canada's seniors?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I believe that, when we commit to taking care of people, we must do so with the utmost care that is required. I know that provinces and territories have a lot of work to do. So do we, at the federal level, and obviously at the local level. We must all work together to protect those people in our lives who are most vulnerable, whether they be seniors, children or others.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We will now move on to Mr. Schmale, HaliburtonKawartha LakesBrock. Mr. Schmale, go ahead.", "Mr. Jamie Schmale (HaliburtonKawartha LakesBrock, CPC): Thank you, Chair. According to Vaughn Palmer in an editorial in the Vancouver Sun regarding the secret Wet'suwet'en deal, Palmer writes:     The hereditary chiefs calculated the two governments would sign despite the objections from the elected chiefs. They likewise got the terms they wanted in the MOU while giving up absolutely nothing. Just as they figured governments would keep the contents secret from the public.   Can the minister describe another situation in which the federal government negotiated a secret deal of this magnitude with unelected people?", "Hon. Carolyn Bennett (Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations): I thank the member for his ongoing concern and I want to remind him that actually it is in keeping with the Supreme Court decision of 1997 that we were to now begin those conversations with the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs who took the case to the Supreme Court. As we've said many times, this is not an agreement; this is an MOU that establishes the path forward for the substantive discussions towards a final agreement, which would describe the future governance and the implementation of Wet'suwet'en rights and title. It is about a shared commitment.", "Mr. Jamie Schmale: Mr. Chair, if it is a shared commitment, why on the eve of the signing ceremony did the four elected chiefs denounce the hereditary chiefs for keeping them in the dark?", "Hon. Carolyn Bennett: Again, it's really important that the member understand that there was a process for the hereditary chiefs to go back to their communities and discuss with them. Any agreement after the good work that will happen now would have to go back and seek the approval of all of the communities.", "Mr. Jamie Schmale: Mr. Chair, the Burns Lake Band members are openly wondering if they're still a band or if the few unelected hereditary chiefs will control everything now. Minister, can you assure them that going forward you will honour their concerns and take the time to listen?", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): I ask honourable members to still direct their questions through the chair. The honourable minister.", "Hon. Carolyn Bennett: Actually, the honourable member knows that the next steps include the further and ongoing engagement by the Wet'suwet'en in their house groups and that will include the six elected chiefs of the Wet'suwet'en nation, their community members and many others. This is about going forward and making sure that any", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Mr. Schmale.", "Mr. Jamie Schmale: Thank you, Chair. Cynthia Joseph, a chief councillor with the Hagwilget First Nation says the MOU between Ottawa, the province and the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs was only shared with her community members on May 9, two days after it was published in the media. Is this part of the open and transparent government all Canadians can expect of the Prime Minister?", "Hon. Carolyn Bennett: Walking the path of reconciliation means that we work with our partners and there is a way that they do the work within their communities. It is going to be an agreement to begin the work, but any final agreement is going to have to be approved by all members of the nation in terms of developing a consensus for the agreement", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Mr. Schmale.", "Mr. Jamie Schmale: Thank you, Chair. Does the minister have any concerns regarding claims by several former female hereditary chiefs that they were stripped of their hereditary status because they didn't agree with the men?", "Hon. Carolyn Bennett: Again, it is going to be really important that the work take place within the Wet'suwet'en nation to determine their future governance, to determine their way of working with Canada and to make sure", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Mr. Schmale.", "Mr. Jamie Schmale: Thank you, Chair. For some reason it seems to be a problem to stand up for these hereditary female chiefs who had their titles taken away. Does the minister plan on recognizing band council resolutions denying the authority of hereditary chiefs to sign any future agreements without consent of the elected chiefs and the 3,000 members within the Wet'suwet'en they represent?", "Hon. Carolyn Bennett: I think the member must understand that, as we begin the work, the nation will do its work and then we will come to the table to determine what the governance would be. Will it be a hybrid model like at Heiltsuk, like Ktunaxa, like some of the communities developing their constitutions, developing their laws and deciding how they will determine their own governance and that partnership with Canada?", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr.Paul-Hus.", "Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus (CharlesbourgHaute-Saint-Charles, CPC): Thank you, Mr.Chair. The current restrictions on non-essential travel at the border do not prevent people from claiming refugee protection if they have family in Canada. Why is the minister refusing to allow married people to cross the border?", "Hon. Bill Blair: I want to thank the honourable member for a very important question. We have heard from many constituents and members of Parliament from right across the country who are expressing concern about non-status spouses being denied entry into the country because their travel is deemed to be non-essential. I've recently been in touch with all of the provinces and territories because I think it's very important that we have their support for any changes", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr.Paul-Hus, you have the floor.", "Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus: If I understand correctly, Mr.Minister, you are talking to provincial representatives, but a case like that of ChantalTremblay, for instance, is unacceptable. For two months now, she has been trying to bring her spouse to Canada, but it isn't working. Is there a way to issue a directive to border services officers that married spousesit's often marriages with Americanscan cross the border to join their spouses in Canada?", "Hon. Bill Blair: Just to be very clearagain, I thank the member opposite for the opportunity to clarify thisit is never our intention to separate families, but at the same time, we have imposed appropriate and necessary restrictions on non-essential travel. Our border services officers inquire of everyone coming to that border about the nature of their travel, and for non-citizens who come to that border seeking entry into Canada, if their entry is deemed non-essential, then they exercise their discretion not to allow", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr.Paul-Hus, you have the floor.", "Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus: Thank you, Mr.Chair. Information from the Canada Border Services Agency has just come out. Since March21, 425,000people have flown into Canada. Among them were 295,000Canadians, which isn't a problem. However, 100,000foreigners have entered Canada, even though the border is supposedly closed. How does the minister explain the fact that 100,000people arrived in Canada by plane?", "Hon. Bill Blair: Again, I thank the member opposite for the opportunity to clarify. We have imposed very significant restrictions on non-essential travel, but of course there are circumstances where individuals come to this country and their entry into Canada is deemed essential. For example, someone who is providing medical services and coming into Canada to provide those services would be deemed essential, because there is a great need among Canadians for those services. It's dealt with on a case-by-case basis. As you can see by the numbers, we have had a very significant reduction in the travel of all non-Canadians to Canada over the past two months.", "Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus: So the minister confirms that the 100,000people who arrived by air were providing a service considered essential to Canada. I'm not talking about the people who crossed the land border, but the people who came to Canada by air.", "Hon. Bill Blair: What I can tell you is that at all points of entry, including our air borders, we apply the standard that the travel must be deemed essential, and that determination is utilized to see if a person is eligible to enter into the country.", "Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus: We're now learning that the Correctional Service of Canada's investigation into the murder of MarylneLevesque is suspended due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Canadians aren't fooled; they know full well that it is a political decision. All the technological means are available to allow the investigation to continue. I'm proof of that today. Can the minister direct the Correctional Service of Canada to resume the investigation into the death of MarylneLevesque?", "Hon. Bill Blair: Again, I thank the member for the question, because we know the concern of the people of Quebec, and the family of Ms. Levesque needs answers and deserves answers. That's why we asked the Parole Board and the Correctional Service of Canada to convene a board of investigation. Clearly, during COVID transmission, the ability to conduct that investigation and to interview all of the witnesses became extremely difficult and has been temporarily suspended, but at the very earliest opportunity we remain resolute to resume that investigation and get to the bottom of it to provide the answers that the family deserves.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr.Paul-Hus, you have only 20seconds remaining.", "Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus: Mr.Chair, victims of crime are one of the segments of the population most affected by the crisis. As we know, the government refuses to allow victims of crime to participate in parole hearings. For the first time in its history, and to add insult to injury, the government has cancelled all activities related to Victims and Survivors of Crime Week, which was to take place next week. Why is the Prime Minister turning his back on victims?", "Hon. Bill Blair: Again, at the earliest days of COVID, until arrangements could be put in place, there were restrictions on victims participating. We have put the systems in place to allow victims to present their evidence virtually, either by video or by phone, to ensure that their voices are heard in these important things. We very much respect and support the role of victims in these determinations, and we're making every effort to ensure that they can participate.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll now to Mr. Cumming, Edmonton Centre.", "Mr. James Cumming (Edmonton Centre, CPC): Mr. Chair, yesterday I asked the Minister of Small Business how many business credit availability guarantees were issued by EDC, and I didn't get a number. Does she have an exact, finite, number of the guarantees today?", "Hon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, thank you to the honourable member for that question. Our government has taken swift and immediate action to support Canadian businesses through this time. Money from this program is flowing, and businesses across the country are receiving the important support that they need.", "Mr. James Cumming: How many BCAP applications have been received so far?", "Hon. Mary Ng: Mr. Chair, these are large loans, and they require important due diligence and adjudication by the financial institutions. We will continue to be open and transparent as the accurate information becomes available.", "Mr. James Cumming: How long does it take to be approved for a BCAP guarantee?", "Hon. Mary Ng: I want to assure the member that we're going to do everything possible to support businesses and workers during this very important time.", "Mr. James Cumming: How many businesses have received funding under the BCAP co-lending program since March?", "Hon. Mary Ng: The lending programs, particularly the program to help small businesses, have really helped lots of businesses. Over 630,000 loans have been issued, and this is really helping those", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Mr. Cumming.", "Mr. James Cumming: Unfortunately, lots is not an answer for the businesses that I'm trying to talk to. Can you tell me, for the CEBA changes that were recently announced, when will we be able to see people who have income through a dividend able to apply?", "Hon. Mary Ng: That's a very important question, Mr. Chair. There's nothing more important to me and to our government than getting these supports out to businesses. Those small businesses that will meet the expanded CEBA criteria are working very diligently with the financial institutions to make sure that they can get access to those loans as quickly as possible.", "Mr. James Cumming: Can the minister give me a day when that will happen?", "Hon. Mary Ng: The financial institutions are working very hard to make sure that they can make this available to businesses.", "Mr. James Cumming: When will a sole proprietor be able to go for those loans?", "Hon. Mary Ng: We will work very hard and very diligently to make sure that these businesses and those sole proprietors are supported.", "Mr. James Cumming: Could they go on Monday?", "Hon. Mary Ng: There is nothing more important than making sure these businesses weather the difficult time of COVID-19, and our measures are", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go back to Mr. Cumming.", "Mr. James Cumming: How about Tuesday?", "Hon. Mary Ng: I think we will all agree that getting support to these businesses is absolutely crucial. Our commitment is always going to be to get support to these businesses.", "Mr. James Cumming: I can't get a distinct answer on any of those questions. Can you tell me how much headroom is left on the CEBA program?", "Hon. Mary Ng: Today, over 630,000 businesses have received the support to do things like pay for salaries, the 25% top-up for the wage subsidy, pay for rent and pay for insurance and utilities. This is what these loans are helping our small", "Mr. James Cumming: How many dollars are left in the program so businesses can have some certainty that the program will be available for some time?", "Hon. Mary Ng: I think you will see that the businesses across the country that I have talked to really appreciate that the government has stepped up to help them during this difficult time. These include women with businesses, indigenous-owned businesses and those small businesses all across our communities, all across the country, that are getting the necessary help. We are going to keep", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go back to Mr. Cumming.", "Mr. James Cumming: How many dollars? It can't be that complicated. How many dollars?", "Hon. Mary Ng: There are 630,000 businesses that are getting help, and thousands more businesses will be getting help with the expanded criteria. We're going to keep doing the work that we need to help our businesses across this country through this difficult time.", "Mr. James Cumming: I heard from a constituent in my riding that they waited for over four hours on the portal for CECRA. Is there an issue with the portal, and if so, when will it be fixed?", "Hon. Mary Ng: Making sure that businesses get the help for commercial rent support is absolutely crucial right now. We are going to endeavour to make sure that this help gets out to those small businesses. Applications have opened in a staggered way and", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): You have time for one last short question, Mr. Cumming.", "Mr. James Cumming: Finally, the Prime Minister yesterday said that a list of all organizations that have been receiving CEWS will be made public. When will that be done?", "Hon. Mary Ng: We have committed to making sure that those companies taking the wage subsidy program will be listed publicly. We have committed to doing that and we will do so.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We now go to Mr. d'Entremont from West Nova. Mr. d'Entremont, go ahead.", "Mr. Chris d'Entremont (West Nova, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I have a question for the Minister of Fisheries, but I thought I would say this first. The Canadian Coast Guard is doing a search at this moment following the loss of a vessel off the coast of Newfoundland. From my community, which is a seafaring, fishing community, I just want to put my thoughts out there to the folks of Newfoundland. We are definitely thinking of them during this difficult time. My first question revolves around the lobster fishery. It's been open in Cape Breton since May 15, I believe. The weather has been good. The harvesters have been going at it every day. The price has dropped to $4.25 already. Unstable markets will probably cause it to drop even more. What is the minister doing to make sure the lobster industry survives?", "Hon. Bernadette Jordan (Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to thank my colleague for his comments with regard to the tragic accident off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, where we saw the loss of life in a fishing accident. Of course, as coastal people, we are all in solidarity with the people of Newfoundland right now. We know that the fish and seafood sector has taken extreme hits because of COVID-19. We're working diligently to make sure we support the industry as best we can. We have made available over half a billion dollars to processors and harvesters to make sure they can weather this storm. We have made sure that the harvesters are able to access the harvester benefit as well as the grant, recognizing the unique nature of their business and how they are not able to access some of our other programs. We are continuing to monitor what is happening in the industry. We will continue to make sure we do everything we can to support the fish and seafood sector.", "Mr. Chris d'Entremont: Mr. Chair, to continue along this vein for a moment, we are still looking at unstable markets for a longer period of time. At this point, processors are being selective in what they're buying. They're not buying culls and other kinds of lobsters. The plants are filling up, and harvesters are worried that they might stop buying product before the season is complete. What can the fishermen expect, or what kinds of programs can they expect, if the season goes bust?", "Hon. Bernadette Jordan: Mr. Chair, we know that this is a very challenging season for our harvesters. We also know that because of the decline in markets, we've had to make accommodations for the processing sector in order to help them be better able to support the harvesters. We have put in $62.5 million, which is allowing the processors to increase capacity in their refrigeration and freezers so that they will continue to be able to purchase product. As I said earlier, we will continue to monitor the situation and make sure we do everything possible to support our harvesters. This is a very difficult", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go back to Mr. d'Entremont.", "Mr. Chris d'Entremont: Mr. Chair, I don't know whether this next question will go to the Minister of DFO or the Minister of Transport. Oakley Ryerson is a resident of West Nova. He is planning a career on the sea and wants to get his master class four. The problem is that he can't pass the eye exam. He needs full-colour vision. For those who are far-sighted or nearsighted, you just have to put on your glasses to correct it. You can actually fly airplanes. I don't know about space shuttles, but who knows? You can now wear colour-corrected lenses, but Transport Canada still does not recognize these for use. Can the Minister of Transport help Ryerson in attaining his chosen profession?", "Hon. Marc Garneau (Minister of Transport): Mr. Chair, I appreciate the concern of my colleague for one of the residents in his riding. I would ask him to write to me and lay out the situation. We have medical standards with respect to a number of different kinds of transportation-related jobs for pilots, mariners and those kinds of occupations, which have to be respected. However, if he sends me the details, I will look into it personally.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr. d'Entremont, you have another 20 to 25 seconds left.", "Mr. Chris d'Entremont: Mr.Chair, the eligibility criteria for financial support include the need to demonstrate a significant loss of income during the months of March and April, yet several SMEs in the tourism industry can't qualify because their operations start with the tourist season, in late May or early June. What will the government do to help them?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, before accessing the emergency wage subsidy, applicants must meet important criteria. However, as we explained last week, we will be adjusting the wage subsidy until the end of August, and we will be reviewing the criteria.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We're going to go to the west coast and the member for SaanichGulf Islands. Ms. May, go ahead.", "Ms. Elizabeth May: Thank you, Mr. Chair. My question is with regard to the urgent problem of mental health crises across Canada. My colleague, Jenica Atwin from Fredericton, held a press conference this morning in which she used the term echo pandemic. We will face an echo pandemic. We're already seeing increases in suicides on southern Vancouver Island. My question to the minister is this: Will we see direct funding to community mental health services as urgently requested by the Canadian Mental Health Association?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I read the honourable member's colleague's letter just today, and I want to reassure all members that we have invested in mental health supports for Canadians, obviously before the pandemic hit but certainly since we've been living with the pandemic. I'd like to remind all members to direct their constituents to the wellnesstogether.ca website and portal. There Canadians can find online resources, as well as connections to real and alive counsellors and other professionals who can help them with their various concerns.", "Ms. Elizabeth May: This question relates to another current emergency: the climate emergency. This week it was reported that the concentration of greenhouse gases reached 417 parts per million. That's not just unprecedented over thousands of years; that's unprecedented over the last one million years. The temperatures in the Arctic broke 86F, 30C in the Arctic circle. The recognized parties in the House have established standing committees to work, but not the committee on the environment. We've asked for this in negotiations. When will the recognized parties remember the June 2019 emergency resolution that we are in a climate emergency, and start making sure that we hit 2020 commitments under the Paris Agreement to improve our targets?", "Hon. Marc Garneau: Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague's questions. I will remind her that we have committed to net-zero emissions by 2050. We've also committed to surpassing the targets that we had originally set for 2030. We realize that along with the COVID pandemic, which is the major problem that exists in the world today, there is another problem as well that affects the entire planet, and that is the problem associated with climate change. We remain committed to achieving those targets.", "Ms. Elizabeth May: My next question will be for Minister Blair, but as an aside, I will say that last answer completely fails to meet the legal requirements of the Paris Agreement to file a new target this year. To save some time, Minister Blair, let's pretend to go back to the questions from my colleague MP Paul-Hus and to your last answer. This is dealt with on a case-by-case basis by CBSA agents. There are thousands of them. They are exercising personal, subjective judgment. This is not acceptable. I'm begging the minister. Could the minister please put out a directive, advice to every CBSA agent on the ground, that when a non-status entry point sees a non-status direct relativehusband, wife, child of a Canadian citizenthat relative be deemed to be entering Canada for an essential purpose?", "Hon. Bill Blair: I'd like to thank the member for bringing this issue forward again. It's an important one. We have been working very hard to ensure that we do everything possible to keep families together. At the same time, we've been working with the provinces and territories, listening to the concerns of Canadians about ensuring that travel across our international border, particularly with the United States, is limited to essential travel. As I've indicated, I've had a number of important conversations and necessary conversations with our provincial and territorial partners. I believe there is a consensus on the right way forward on this, and we're working very diligently to put it in place. I want to assure the member opposite that we have given very clear direction to our CBSA officers. I believe our border services officers have been doing an extraordinary job for us in the exercise of their discretion. At the same time, they have been doing the important work of ensuring the health and safety of Canadians at our border.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We're now going to Ms. Kwan for Vancouver East. Ms. Kwan, go ahead.", "Ms. Jenny Kwan (Vancouver East, NDP): Four out of the five homes listed in the armed forces report were for-profit. It is painfully clear that corporate profits are being put ahead of the well-being of seniors. Will the minister admit that the for-profit model is failing our loved ones and commit to getting profits out of long-term care?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: As the member opposite notes, nobody can read that report or hear those stories without feeling absolute horror and disgust and without demanding better for the elders in our lives. As I have mentioned many times in the House, our government remains committed to working with provinces and territories to ensure that every elder person in our community can age with dignity and in safety.", "Ms. Jenny Kwan: Minister, if that's the case, I will ask again. Will the minister make sure that the focus of long-term care homes is taking care of seniors and not taking care of owners' bank accounts?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: As the member will obviously know, long-term care remains in the jurisdiction of provinces and territories, and there is legislation that rules them as such. As the member also knows, we have stood by Ontario and all of the other provinces and territories throughout this outbreak. The Prime Minister has been very clear", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We will go back to Ms. Kwan.", "Ms. Jenny Kwan: Is the minister refusing to answer the question because she agrees that profit should come before care?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: I think it's unfortunate that the member is trying to place words in my mouth. What I do agree with, though, is that long-term care needs to be reformed, and I think all provinces and territories know, and all Canadians know, that we have to do a better job.", "Ms. Jenny Kwan: It's simple for the minister. She can just answer the question. Is she willing to defend for-profit care for our seniors? Is she in favour of for-profit private health care too?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: What I am willing to defend is the right for all Canadians to age with safety and dignity.", "Ms. Jenny Kwan: To the minister, what is the difference? Why sell out the care of our seniors? Will she commit that she will take profit out of long-term care?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I think the member opposite knows that the only way to actually reform long-term care is to work with provinces and territories, in fact, all levels of government, to ensure that the people who spent their lives caring for and nurturing us can end their lives with caring and nurturing", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We will go back to Ms. Kwan.", "Ms. Jenny Kwan: I think the minister knows that what we need is national standards for seniors' care. The Revera long-term care homes are owned by the Public Sector Pension Investment Board. Since the government owns these homes, has the military been sent in there to see what's happening to seniors under their care?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, we know that it is important to work with all of the provinces and territories under whose jurisdiction it falls to protect the seniors within those care homes. That's what we've been doing since the beginning of the outbreak of the coronavirus, and that's what we'll continue to do to protect the lives of seniors and strengthen their protection. We will, as I said, Mr. Chair, work with the provinces and territories to have a longer-term plan so that all seniors can age with dignity and safety.", "Ms. Jenny Kwan: The government has a clear responsibility here. What is the government doing to ensure the standards of care in these Revera homes that they own?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, as I have repeatedly said, the jurisdiction for care of long-term care homes falls within the provincial and territorial realm. However, that being said, Mr. Chair, we have been there for provinces and territories since the outbreak of the coronavirus, and as the member opposite has clearly or likely heard the Prime Minister say, we will stand with provinces and territories as all elders have the right to age with dignity", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Ms. Kwan.", "Ms. Jenny Kwan: I didn't hear an answer, Mr. Chair, so the answer is nothing, then. Do you think that the families of the seniors in these homes want to hear those excuses about jurisdictional issues? Does the minister not think that the families want to hear that the federal government is doing all it can to care for their parents?", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): I would remind the members to direct their questions through the chair. The honourable minister.", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Quite frankly, I don't think that families care which level of government is responsible for caring for their elders. I think what they care about is that their elders are cared for. That's in fact what the Prime Minister believes. That's in fact what our government believes, and that's why we have willingly stepped up to say to provinces and territories that we will be there with you to make sure that all seniors in our lives have the right to age with dignity and care.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We will now give the floor to Mrs.Gill, from the riding of Manicouagan. Go ahead, Mrs.Gill.", "Mrs. Marilne Gill (Manicouagan, BQ): Mr.Chair, my question is for the Prime Minister who, earlier, clearly told us that the government's assistance is intended for those who are most in need and most vulnerable. I come from a riding where a lot of people make their living from the tourism industry. I don't know if the PrimeMinister read the newspapers yesterday, but in Quebec, losses to the tune of $4billion are expected until March2021 in the tourism accommodation sector alone. The service sector will lose 93,000jobs. How can I justify to my constituents the fact that a political party, which does not need it, has already seen money from the emergency wage subsidy, when people in my riding don't yet have access to it because of the seasonal nature of their work? These people haven't seen the money that is available through these programs.", "Hon. Bill Morneau: We think it is very important to protect the country's employees in all sectors of the economy. Through this approach, there will be more jobs after the pandemic, and the economic situation will be better. We will continue this approach.", "Mrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, this is the wrong approach. They are saying that they are protecting the jobs of the Liberal Party of Canada, which does not need the money. I'll ask a question similar to the previous one. Fishers in my riding did not qualify for the emergency wage subsidy. Another program was created for them, which isn't quite the same and doesn't really meet their needs. A government whose political wingnot the parliamentary wingdoesn't really need money takes money from the fund, but leaves fishers to make do with less generous programs that don't meet their needs. What do I tell the fishers in my riding?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we know that many sectors of the economy across the country are facing challenges. That's why we have adopted an approach with consistent criteria for all employees in all sectors. We have also introduced specific measures to help certain sectors, such as the fishing industry. We will continue our approach because we believe it's the best way to protect employees and our economy.", "Mrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, I'm still not satisfied. The government is saying that the best way to proceed is to give money to the political wing of the Liberal Party of Canada, when there are people who are getting nothing. What am I supposed to tell seasonal workers, who have absolutely no assurances for their future? I can't go back to my riding and say I'm proud of the work the government is doing or our efforts in the House. It's true, the House is closed right now. I forgot. I have a very hard time accepting that the government is helping employees of the Liberal Party in preparation for the next election campaign, when communities in my region are dying because their economies revolve around a single industry. I can't tell them I'm not ashamed of what's going on as we speak.", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we felt it was necessary to put emergency programs in place in response to the crisis during the pandemic. That is our approach. The emergency wage subsidy is a program that is clearly meant to ensure employees are protected and maintain their relationship with their employer. As for the Canada emergency response benefit, it means a lot to people who don't have a job. We are going to stick to our approach, which is to use consistent criteria to help all employees and all Canadians around the country struggling in any sector of the economy.", "Mrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, I think the honourable Minister of Finance lives in an ivory tower. No, he is not protecting all jobs. No, he is not protecting all sectors of the economy. Once again, I will say that a party that doesn't need money has already received subsidies. However, people who need that money, people who are actually losing money or who don't know if they'll even be working this summer are getting zilch. There is absolutely no justifying that. I'd at least like to know whether the government is ashamed of what it's doing. When people have a conscience, eventually, they want to make up for their mistakes. Are the Liberals going to return that money? Is the finance minister going to help all sectors of the economy, including tourism, fisheries and seasonal industries?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for her question. Our approach is based on consistent criteria. The emergency wage subsidy is meant for any sector of the economy where revenues have dropped by 30% or more. The measure is hugely important for organizations that are really struggling, because we can protect their workers. We are also providing the Canada emergency response benefit to other employees, meaning, those who have lost their income because of COVID-19. Consequently, we will keep up our approach to ensure we continue to fare as well as possible and the economy works well after the pandemic.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we'll go to our last group of interventions, and that will be from Ms. Jansen in CloverdaleLangley City. Ms. Jansen, go ahead.", "Mrs. Tamara Jansen (CloverdaleLangley City, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to begin with a shout-out to the brave waiters and waitresses at our local Earls restaurant and Browns Socialhouse, who have been opened again for on-site dining this week. Here in B.C. we're beginning to find our new normal, and it was great to see how small businesses have so quickly adapted their establishments to keep their workers and patrons safe while allowing people to get back to the business of living. You guys rock. Thanks for taking the lead. Mr. Chair, here in my riding I recently had contact with the mayor of Langley City who was wondering if I had any way of accessing personal protective gear, because our local firefighters were running out of stock. Then again yesterday, I spoke with one of our local homeless shelters that is also looking for PPE. Dr. Tam is telling all Canadians to wear masks in public, but I'm wondering if the Minister of Public Service and Procurement could tell us where exactly we're going to get all those masks with the current shortage.", "Hon. Anita Anand: I want to be clear that our priority as a federal government has been to respond to provincial and territorial requests for PPE that goes to front-line health care workers. That is our priority, and we've been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets. We are now actively also exploring ways in which we can assist broader organizations across the country with PPE needs, and that is something that I'll continue to update the House on as we go forward.", "Mrs. Tamara Jansen: A Globe and Mail article revealed that government orders for N95 masks have steadily been dropping. We've gone from over 200 million ordered to 100 million, according to a federal source. Mr. Chair, the number of N95 masks ordered, as reported on the department's website, does continue to fall. Will the minister tell us why we seem to continue to struggle to supply PPE to Canadians?", "Hon. Anita Anand: It is no secret that we are in a global competition for N95 masks and other supplies, so the Government of Canada's approach is to diversify supply chains internationally and build up and retool domestic industry so that we can have these supplies going forward. In terms of the numbers on our web page, we have short-term and long-term contracts in place", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We go back to Ms. Jansen.", "Mrs. Tamara Jansen: Yes, I understand that a number of Chinese mask manufacturers have been nationalized, and products for Canadians have been confiscated by the CCP government. Is the drop in N95 orders due to, in actual fact, contracts being cancelled?", "Hon. Anita Anand: On N95 masks, I would like to assure the member and the House that we have multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks, including with 3M in the United States, whose masks are crossing our border weekly over the next month.", "Mrs. Tamara Jansen: That didn't quite answer my question. Have any of our orders been cancelled by the nationalization of these manufacturers in China?", "Hon. Anita Anand: We have an aide in place in China. We have our embassy and other firms actively ensuring that our supplies from the manufacturing source make their way to the warehouse. Over 40 flights have come to Canada with those masks and other supplies. Our supply chains are operating despite the global environment being highly competitive.", "Mrs. Tamara Jansen: We know many millions of N95 masks have arrived in Canada from China and have been substandard. What is the total number of substandard masks that have arrived?", "Hon. Anita Anand: Mr. Chair, as previously explained to the House, about eight million masks did not meet spec by the Public Health Agency of Canada and have been repurposed to some extent in other areas of the system.", "Mrs. Tamara Jansen: In a previous committee, the deputy minister advised us that Medicom was shoulder-tapped by the government to consider producing PPE. How many other companies did the government approach for this contract?", "Hon. Anita Anand: We have operated in a very urgent way in order to procure supplies for front-line health care workers. We are now also moving to ensure that we have competitions run for the procurement of personal protective equipment. It's a multi-pronged approach, and our priority is to get supplies out to front-line health care workers in this time of crisis as quickly as possible. Thank you so much.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Just before we adjourn, I think this another mark of accomplishment on behalf of the great team here at the House of Commons. There have been some great efforts, even since yesterday evening, to get this turned around for today. My compliments to all members joining us here in the House and to all members who have joined by virtual conference. The committee is now adjourned until noon tomorrow.

And we 'll do", "Grad E: Oh . OK , sure . So , um , last week I finally got results from the SRI system about this mean subtraction approach . And , um , we  we got an improvement , uh , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , um ,  six percent to four point five percent , um , on the n on the far - mike data using PZM F , but , um , the near - mike performance worsened , um , from one point two percent to two point four percent . And , um , wh why would that be , um ,  considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ? And so , uh , with some input from , uh , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts . Um , first of all HTK  sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation , and so HTK wasn't . Um , so this , um  This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel  normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case . And also , um , the  Andreas pointed out the SRI system is using more parameters . It 's got finer - grained acoustic models . So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts  in the re - synthesized audio . Um . And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background . And so that seems like it could be difficult for training , cuz you could have  different phones  lined up with a different foreground phone ,  um ,  depending on  the timing of the echo . So , um , I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set , and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them . So I 'm planning to use the Macrophone set of , um , read speech , and , um  Hmm .", "Professor B: I had another thought just now , which is , uh , remember we were talking before about  we were talking in our meeting about , uh , this stuff that  some of the other stuff that Avendano did , where they were , um , getting rid of low - energy  sections ? Um , uh , if you  if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in  late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , uh , uh , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , uh , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a  an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values , and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum . So , what  what Hirsch did was , uh , set them to zero  set the negative values to zero . So if you imagine a  a waveform that 's all positive , which is the time trajectory of energy , um , and , uh , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . You know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in  So in this case you have some artificially imposed  reverberation - like thing . I mean , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation , but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in , uh , at n And , um , what if you did  ? I mean , there 's nothing to say that the  the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation . I mean , you also could , uh , just try to make it nicer .", "Grad E: Uh - huh .", "Professor B: And one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of VAD - like thing", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Professor B: and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some  some , uh , very low or  or near zero  value .

I mean , you do it in a pretty conservative way", "Grad E: OK .", "Professor B: so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to  keep in an echo than to throw out speech .", "Grad E: Hmm .", "PhD G: Um , what is the reverberation time  like  there ?", "Grad E: In thi in this room ?

But the other thing is , he 's putting in  w I was using the word \" reverberation \" in two ways .

So the next thing , maybe I  what I will  try to  to do is just  to try to smooth mmm ,  the , um  to smooth the d the result of the subtraction , to get rid of the musical noise , using some kind of filter , or", "PhD G: Can smooth the SNR estimate , also .", "PhD C: Yeah . Right . Mmm .", "PhD G: Your filter is a function of SNR . Hmm ?", "PhD C: Yeah . So , to get something that 's  would be closer to  what you tried to do with Wiener filtering .", "PhD G: Yeah .", "PhD C: And  Mm - hmm . Yeah .", "PhD G: Actually , it 's , uh  Uh . I don't know , it 's  go ahead .", "PhD C: It", "PhD G: And it 's", "PhD C: Maybe you can", "PhD G: go ahead .", "PhD C: I think it 's  That 's it for me .", "PhD G: OK . So , uh  u th I 've been playing with this Wiener filter , like . And there are  there were some bugs in the program , so I was p initially trying to clear them up . Because one of the bug was  I was assuming that always the VAD  uh , the initial frames were silence . It always started in the silence state , but it wasn't for some utterances . So the  it wasn't estimating the noise initially , and then it never estimated , because I assumed that it was always silence .", "PhD C: Mm - hmm . So this is on SpeechDat - Car Italian ?", "PhD G: Yeah .", "PhD C: So , in some cases s there are also", "PhD G: SpeechDat - Car Italian . Yeah . There 're a few cases , actually , which I found later , that there are .", "PhD C: o Uh - huh .", "PhD G: So that was one of the  bugs that was there in estimating the noise . And , uh , so once it was cleared , uh , I ran a few experiments with  different ways of smoothing the estimated clean speech and how t estimated the noise and , eh , smoothing the SNR also . And so the  the trend seems to be like ,  uh , smoothing the  current estimate of the clean speech for deriving the SNR , which is like  deriving the Wiener filter , seems to be helping . Then updating it quite fast using a very small time constant . So we 'll have , like , a few results where the  estimating the  the  More smoothing is helping . But still it 's like  it 's still comparable to the baseline . I haven't got anything beyond the baseline . But that 's , like , not using any Wiener filter . And , uh , so I 'm  I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR . So there are three time constants that I have . So , I 'm just playing around . So , one is fixed in the line , like  Smoothing the clean speech is  is helping , so I 'm not going to change it that much . But , the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying  trying a little bit . So , that h And the other thing is , like , putting a floor on the , uh , SNR , because that  if some  In some cases the clean speech is , like  when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values , so the SNR is , like , very low . And so that actually creates a lot of variance in the low - energy region of the speech . So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't  vary a lot in the low - energy regions . And , uh . So . The results are , like  So far I 've been testing only with the  baseline , which is  which doesn't have any LDA filtering and on - line normalization . I just want to separate the  the contributions out . So it 's just VAD , plus the Wiener filter , plus the baseline system , which is , uh , just the spectral  I mean , the mel sp mel , uh , frequency coefficients . Um . And the other thing that I tried was  but I just  took of those , uh ,   Carlos filters , which Hynek had , to see whether it really h helps or not . I mean , it was just a  a run to see whether it really degrades or it helps . And it 's  it seems to be like it 's not  hurting a lot by just blindly picking up one filter which is nothing but a  four hertz  a band - pass m m filter on the cubic root of the power spectrum . So , that was the filter that Hy - uh , Carlos had . And so  Yeah . Just  just to see whether it really  it 's  it 's  is it worth trying or not . So , it doesn't seems to be degrading a lot on that . So there must be something that I can  that can be done with that type of noise compensation also , which   I guess I would ask Carlos about that . I mean , how  how he derived those filters and  and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories , added with some type of noise which  what we are using currently , or something like that . So maybe I 'll", "Professor B: This is cubic root of power spectra ?", "PhD G: Yeah . Cubic root of power spectrum .", "Professor B: So , if you have this band - pass filter , you probably get n you get negative values . Right ?", "PhD G: Yeah . And I 'm , like , floating it to z zeros right now .", "Professor B: OK .", "PhD G: So it has , like  the spectrogram has , like  Uh , it actually , uh , enhances the onset and offset of  I mean , the  the begin and the end of the speech . So it 's  there seems to be , like , deep valleys in the begin and the end of , like , high - energy regions ,", "Professor B: Mm - hmm .", "PhD G: because the filter has , like , a sort of Mexican - hat type structure .", "Professor B: Mm - hmm .", "PhD G: So , those are the regions where there are , like  when I look at the spectrogram , there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech . But the rest of it seems to be , like , pretty nice .", "Professor B: Mm - hmm .", "PhD G: So . That 's  something I observe using that filter . And  Yeah . There are a few  very  not a lot of  because the filter doesn't have a  really a deep negative portion , so that it 's not really creating a lot of negative values in the cubic root . So , I 'll  I 'll s may continue with that for some w I 'll  I 'll  Maybe I 'll ask Carlos a little more about how to play with those filters , and  but while  making this Wiener filter better . So . Yeah . That  that 's it , Morgan .", "Professor B: Uh , last week you were also talking about building up the subspace  stuff ?", "PhD G: Yeah .

Very interesting .", "User Interface: Uh", "Project Manager: Industrial Designer . Interface concept .", "User Interface: Yes , well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences .  Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the LCD uh display . Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples .", "User Interface: Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's  that they're all pretty uh uh high uh", "Marketing: Large .", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah . Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long .", "Marketing: A lot  a lot of buttons buttons .", "User Interface: Um , power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right . Um , well we see the the the same uh arrows . Like there . And uh  Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that . But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ .", "User Interface: So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: Um  Yeah . So , that's", "Project Manager: Can you go back one page ? For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? We don't have buttons for the menu .", "User Interface: Uh , well", "Project Manager: Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel  .", "User Interface: Yeah . I thought that was our uh idea .", "Project Manager: Okay . But  uh", "User Interface: So , uh how", "Project Manager: You have to put it on the", "User Interface: Like this .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: Or or this . And that the menu button is okay .", "Project Manager: Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .", "User Interface: Yeah , okay .", "Marketing: Yes .", "User Interface: Uh , so the  The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one .", "User Interface: Yeah . Uh , well that's something to uh think about .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it .", "User Interface: Okay .", "Marketing: Okay .", "User Interface: Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting .", "User Interface: But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think .", "Project Manager: Not too much colours .", "User Interface: Uh , no . Not too much .", "Project Manager: No , it's not flower power .", "User Interface: But uh  No , no , no .

So , you're next .", "Industrial Designer: I'm next , okay .  Yes . No . Here we go .", "Industrial Designer: Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want ,", "Marketing: Okay .", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red . Uh , so it's visible . Uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said . Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . But to give him the shape of your hand , so you  it's easier to use or something like that . But that's just an idea . And then , I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . The battery , there are few options . Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket . Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . When you uh shake it a few times , it it's loaded . Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice  have it curved . And maybe like it's hand-shaped . Uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic uh because uh  it won't have to burst uh like in the  in one time . And also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research . Uh the push-buttons . We have one new thing uh discovered . It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel . And also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it's also uh easy to use . Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . You can do it with your thumb . And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons", "Marketing: Hmm .", "Industrial Designer: uh if you  push uh channel one , you can see channel one . The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . There are also uh simple chips . They are uh cheaper . Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and I think there are a lot of those uh things , and people won't buy it any more . They have seen enough of it . And you have also advanced um chips . But that's with the LCD uh screen . And the costs will increase a lot more . And I think our budget is too low to use and an LCD , and the chip who is more expensive . And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the  for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . Like , you get a yellow uh remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera . You have any more questions about this ? I think the main thing is we look at the costs .", "Marketing: Yep .", "Project Manager: Hmm .", "Industrial Designer: And not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has .", "Marketing: Yeah . But , thi i uh  This is with an LCD ? No ,", "Industrial Designer: Not with an LCD .", "Marketing: not .", "Project Manager: No , isn't .", "Industrial Designer: No .", "Project Manager: But the LCD is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . But then , what I say , the costs will uh get a lot higher .", "Project Manager: But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel . If you don't", "Industrial Designer: Th then you'll see it on the television .", "Project Manager: Hmm , yes . But then . Yeah , then you go one down one up . When you scroll .", "Industrial Designer: but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . Yeah", "Project Manager: but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . Yeah So you may not be uh", "Project Manager: No . The television must do that . So", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control .", "Project Manager: Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room . And mostly they are smaller . So", "Industrial Designer: Yes . But that won't be a problem . I think .", "Project Manager: Most the times that are not advanced televisions .", "Industrial Designer: No , but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls .", "Industrial Designer: And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . Uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with LCD or without ?", "Industrial Designer: I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . But I don't know uh how much higher .", "Marketing: 'Cause it", "Project Manager: That's important .", "Marketing: I think if we have an LCD , it will also sell a lot better .", "Industrial Designer: That's true .", "Marketing: And that might uh bring back the costs uh", "Industrial Designer: But then we'll  I think we must discuss who  uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a LCD . And then a flat um remote control . Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without LCD .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Maybe you can look how how much it is for the LCD .", "Industrial Designer: I can uh look on my uh", "Project Manager: It's very important .", "Industrial Designer: Uh  Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip .", "Project Manager: Yeah , more expensive . But how much ?", "Industrial Designer: Doesn't say .", "Project Manager: Oh .", "User Interface: Hmm .", "Marketing: Huh .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: That's from my manufacturing division .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: 'Kay .", "Project Manager: Well , thank you .", "Industrial Designer: Yes ?", "Marketing: My turn ?", "Project Manager: Next .", "Marketing: Mm . So  So  Yeah . So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching . Uh , I did some trend-watching . It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends .  'Cause if you don't , you won't sell . So , well how we did do that ? Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan . Of course , well known for their uh trend  uh trends . And well , uh what did you find ? Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products . And um , material ? That should feel  have uh a spongy feeling . And to get a feeling for what it is , uh here is an image of it . Then the old and rich . They like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes .", "Marketing: And um , they also like uh familiar material , uh especially wood . Now , another picture .", "Marketing: To get a feeling for this . Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . We uh aim at the younger market . So , we should also be uh look at their uh trends . However , with trends it's always if there's  it's now . It it it might last one year , and next year it be  uh can be totally different . And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year . So , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be totally different next year . So , that's uh one thing to keep in mind .", "Industrial Designer: Changing covers .", "Marketing: Yeah . Any questions ?", "Industrial Designer: Nope .", "Project Manager: No . It's clear .", "User Interface: No .", "Project Manager: So now , it's uh   Ah , let's see . Now , w we have to decide  Well , we have to decide on the concept . So , we have to look at  'S next . Components and user interface concept . So  Now , we have to make some concept . Maybe one of you can paint it on the board . First , uh user interface .", "Industrial Designer: Uh , uh-uh . How w how we how we make it ? Uh", "Project Manager: Yes , a concept on uh", "Project Manager: Just", "Industrial Designer: Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah , but maybe we can paint it . Uh , what do we want ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , but if I paint with", "Project Manager: I'll paint . Okay .", "Project Manager: Well", "Marketing: Mm .", "Project Manager: Something like this ? Or  Shapes or  What do we need ?", "User Interface: Mm , yes . What ?", "Marketing: Can make several uh concepts .", "Project Manager: Yes , okay .", "Marketing: We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: More like something", "Marketing: Yeah I I I uh  yes .", "Industrial Designer: M like  Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it .", "Project Manager: And you have to .", "Industrial Designer: Uh", "Industrial Designer: I have to .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I'm not a designer . It's more  three D_ . Like , um when you have a part here . This is the remote control . And then you have something like th this under it .

So , there's no menu .", "Industrial Designer: I don't know . It's like some sort of uh teletext option , but we don't have teletext .", "Project Manager: No . So you can't use it .", "Industrial Designer: And if we put an LCD thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher .", "Project Manager: Okay , we make two concepts . One with LCD .

Out .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: No , it's not good .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Now , second concept . One with LCD , one without LCD .

A little bit bigger , with easier thi", "Project Manager: Mean , it's better . But how expensive it is ?", "Industrial Designer: I don't know .", "Project Manager: Oh . Why do I pay you for ?", "Project Manager: Um , well  um   Better ideas .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Or no scroll uh things . Just a shape . And   No , no . It won't work .", "Project Manager: For the young peoples I think scroll button's good .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Uh-huh .", "Project Manager: So  Think we have to keep them .", "Industrial Designer: Or a remote control more like joystick .", "Project Manager: Yeah , but is it  That's not expensive than uh  Joystick is better .

I mean the the shape of the remote control .", "Project Manager: Oh the sh Yeah , but then you can", "Industrial Designer: Just like a Playstation thing . Yeah .", "Project Manager: So  Maybe , if it's possible ,  it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better .", "Project Manager: A small one . So , please look at it .", "Industrial Designer: No , that's okay , I got", "Marketing: And on the LCD , how much it costs ? Uh , it costs extra ?", "Industrial Designer: Uh   they're not uh in details .", "Industrial Designer: It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ?", "Project Manager: Yeah we  I think you get it .

{"meeting_id": "m_val_22", "domain": "committee", "meeting_transcripts": ["Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies, and I'm very pleased to welcome Angela Burns, who is substituting for Suzy this morning. We've also received apologies from Dawn Bowden. Can I also welcome Si\u00e2n Gwenllian to the meeting? Si\u00e2n is joining us from her constituency office via video-conference. Can I ask Members if they've got any declarations of interest, please? Hefin.", "Hefin David AM: Apologies. I'm currently registered as an associate lecturer at Cardiff Metropolitan University, although I haven't done any work for them for some time.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you very much. We'll move on, then, to item 2 this morning, which is our evidence session on the higher education new academic year allocations. I'm very pleased to welcome David Blaney, who is chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and Bethan Owen, who is deputy chief executive of HEFCW. Thank you, both, for attending this morning. We're looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions are from Angela Burns.", "Angela Burns AM: Good morning. Thank you very much, indeed. I just wanted to talk about, really, the financial sustainability of the higher education sector because, as we know, there's been all sorts of things going on in the press. So, can I just start with, actually, quite a technical question and ask you what the financial indicators look like for the universities here in Wales, and are there particular indicators that are really flashing warning signals to you?", "Dr David Blaney: Well, shall I just start with a couple of contextualising comments and Bethan can come in then with some detail? It's undeniably the case there are financial challenges facing our universities. They result from three main causes: one is the impact of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, which is deeper and longer in Wales than it is elsewhere in the UK. There are increased pension costs and, actually, increased costs generally. And, of course, we also have current uncertainty as a result of the Augar review in England, and whether that might play into Wales, and also Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales; the majority of the UK universities are actually taking out cost one way or another. So, this is not a Welsh issue. Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales, there was a pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales, and even now, that's still the case. So, Welsh higher education institutions are approximately \u00a340 million worse off than they would be in the English system. That's a challenge, and that is a result from a political decision to invest in students, and that's fine. The money's gone into the system but it hasn't gone into universities, necessarily. So, these are serious challenges for institutions to manage, but I think it is a managed situation. We're not seeing a crisis; we are seeing some real challenges, and there is a distinction, I think, between\u2014. We have to understand, though, that taking out cost to balance the books has a detrimental effect on the capacity. Obviously it impacts on the people who lose their jobs immediately, but there's a medium to longer term impact on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales. They are taking out capacity; they're not cutting at fat now, they're cutting out core capacity. And so, the range of the curriculum, the range of research and innovation, the range of the contribution that universities can make will be diminished by that. And against that backdrop, the introduction of the Diamond reforms is hugely important\u2014delivery of that is going to be really important\u2014and we are really pleased to see the Minister able to meet her commitments in respect of that. The Diamond money is coming in. This forthcoming year will be the first year we see an increase in the resource, through us, to higher education. And the projections in future years are better still, and that will be extremely important. The performance of the sector is very good; we had the national student survey results out yesterday. Wales is still the best in the UK, which is excellent. We have the best impact from research in Wales across the UK. So, all of that is very positive, but that is also being done at some cost. There are some very tired staff in universities, and we've seen some stuff in the press recently about some of the impact of stress there as well.", "Angela Burns AM: Can I bring you back to the financial element of that? Can I just ask a question: what are the university reserves\u00a0looking like at present?", "Dr David Blaney: Here, I refer to my learned friend.", "Bethan Owen: The reserves are a measure. There's a difference between the distributable reserves\u2014I don't have those numbers before me, but looking at reserves, what is more important are those reserves that are available as cash or liquid cash. So, universities have reserves, but a large amount of that is tied up in their estates, so they're not immediately realisable. So, one of the key measures that we're looking at, which is even more important than surpluses and deficit, is the operating cash that our universities are generating at the moment. When we look at operating cash in 2017-18, they were generating, as a percentage of income, about 7.6 per cent, which contrasts with nearly 10 per cent for the same year for English institutions. And that represents their capacity to generate surplus cash to meet their costs, which now, increasingly, include the costs of servicing their borrowings. So, again, because capital funding has not been as available to universities as it was, they've invested in their estates and that's largely been funded by borrowings. The costs of those borrowings have to be met on an annual basis, so that's becoming an increasing proportion of the operating cash that universities have.", "Angela Burns AM: I just asked that question because I know that about four years ago, the universities were sitting on substantial reserves and were less than keen to deploy them back into actually using them for the students\u2014it was more about building up the war chest, if you like, of the universities. And I just really wanted to have an understanding of how that picture might have changed over the last four years and are they actually skinnier cats now, rather than before.", "Bethan Owen: We can get you that analysis, but even four years ago, I think the definition of exactly what's meant by reserves, it's really important to look at what are distributable reserves as opposed to the assets that universities have.", "Angela Burns AM: Yes, I do understand the difference.", "Bethan Owen: And, there are also differences in the way that universities have secured funding for investing in their estates. So, for example, Cardiff University have had a bond rather than borrowing, which you draw down as you're spending. So, in the short term, the reserves of Cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances, but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and, over the next two or three years, will be utilised for that.", "Angela Burns AM: So, overall, you're painting a picture of a sector that's under a significant degree of financial stress, and this is obviously using your key financial indicators. Do you monitor each and every university, or do you wait for them to come back and tell you what their situation is?", "Bethan Owen: We monitor, we receive forecasts, five-year forecasts, and we meet frequently with all our universities now. It varies, depending on the risks of the universities, as to how frequently we meet, but we're actually meeting with every university because even the forecast that we received last July, the changes, even in the 12-month period, are significant enough for us to need a better understanding of what the latest position is. The forecasts, if I just run through\u2014. We had a sector that, in 2017-18, had a deficit. Although it had a turnover and income of \u00a31.5 billion, which had increased, nonetheless it had a small deficit of 0.4 per cent of income in 2017-18, which was an improvement on the deficit the year before of 1.7 per cent, but notably, again, the sector in England were looking at surpluses of 3 per cent to 4 per cent in the same period. The forecasts that we had this time last year were indicating that, for 2018-19, we should have a sector that's roughly in a break-even position, but that has to be caveated with waiting for new forecasts in July, where there will have to be a reflection of the pension costs, and there have been significant changes in pension costs, both for the teachers' pension scheme\u00a0and the universities' superannuation scheme as well, and those will be significant costs\u00a0that universities have to build into their forecasts at a time when their income, certainly their fee income, is not increasing, and that is the challenge.", "Angela Burns AM: Are we going to lose any universities in the next couple of years?", "Dr David Blaney: I don't think so. As I said earlier on, we're not seeing a crisis, we're seeing really challenging circumstances for institutions to manage. At the moment, our sense is they are managing them, so one of the things we try to do is to make sure that, insofar as we can see it, we are making sure that the institutions are alert to the challenges they're facing, and are actually engaging those challenges properly, and we are seeing that at the moment. So I think what we will see if the pressure continues unabated is more costs being taken out, so more jobs being lost, more capacity being lost, but that's not the same as falling over. I don't see people falling over. There is always the possibility of structural change within the sector, and that might be one of the solutions that institutions think about, but it's not a policy position, and it's not always a good short-term response to crisis anyway, actually. But I think, as I say, we're in a managed situation, but the challenges are quite acute. But I don't see an institution falling over in the foreseeable future.", "Angela Burns AM: When you talk about structural change, are you referring to the fact that certain offshoots or divisions might close? I bring this up because I'm the Assembly Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, and I have had multiple representations from students, and their parents, who are about to go to Lampeter and who've been told that courses are being restructured, there's a massive staff loss, and they have concerns about whether the three-year commitment they're about to make to a course is going to be able to be sustained. So I am trying to drill down a little bit, because I think it's only fair for the students to know what they're up against, and also it's a bit like in the great depression\u2014you can start a run on something, can't you? Because if enough people believe it, then suddenly enough people will stop going to what is an excellent little university, really top-quality in medieval literature, in archaeology. And I'm just talking about one, but I know there are problems in other universities around Wales, so I just wondered if you could comment on that and also what processes you as HEFCW might have in place to protect any student who does find themselves in a situation where their course appears to be disappearing before their eyes.", "Dr David Blaney: So, there's quite a lot in that question, actually. Let me try not to forget any of the elements. First of all, your comment about causing a run is a serious consideration. So, if we look at the debate that happened in the Senedd last week, from my reading of the transcript, it was actually quite a balanced debate where pretty much every contributor made reference to the contribution that higher education is making. There was reference to the national student survey scores, and in many ways Wales is the best place in the UK to come and be a student, because you are looked after properly in Wales. But there was also a perfectly legitimate exploration of whether or not there's a crisis, and if you look at the way in which that was represented in the media, the crisis bit stuck and the rest of it didn't. At the point where the sector is trying very hard to recruit students, it's really quite unhelpful that you get that sort of representation. So we do need to make sure, I think, all of us, that we try to avoid a situation where there can be media amplification of a problem that's not actually as acute as the media are portraying it, and that is very harsh. I'm not being critical of the political process here, but it has ripples and we do need to be careful that we don't start a run on this. In terms of the specifics at Lampeter, we understand that there are no plans to close any of the departments, and there certainly will not be plans to pull the rug out from under continuing students. That is just not what institutions do. So there's an absolute obligation on them to meet their commitments, and that's a contractual obligation anyway, so it's a legal obligation. But we also have a quality machinery that we operate where we would expect institutions to be able to demonstrate that they've put in place appropriate arrangements to ensure that students can finish their programmes of study. So they're not going to be recruiting students to programmes that they're not planning to continue\u2014they just are not going to do that. And if you think about it in a market context, it would be suicidal for a university to treat their students like that.", "Angela Burns AM: But I have to ask these questions because the auditor was very clear that there was a material uncertainty in Trinity Saint David's financial plans.", "Dr David Blaney: Yes, I understand that, so let\u2019s come back to the material uncertainty. [Interruption.] No, I understand, and that's fine. What I'm hoping to try and express is that we have absolute confidence that the institutions will not do the dirty on their students. They will look after their students and if they're recruiting to programmes, they are recruiting to programmes that they are planning to run, and run through to completion. And the expectations that we place on them in terms of our quality assurance machinery is precisely that\u2014when they are engaged in portfolio change, they have to look after the interest of the students that they currently have. In terms of our oversight and monitoring, our primary consideration, again, is the interest of the students. They are the people who have, in many ways, least influence over what happens in terms of the way an institution is managed. Although, they do have a voice and, actually, the arrangements for the student voice in Wales are, again, better than elsewhere in the UK. But, nonetheless, we do not wish to see students becoming innocent victims of difficulties of management and financing. And so that is our primary consideration when we're looking at these institutions. Our institutional risk review process is fundamentally designed to make sure that institutions are grappling with their problems before they become a crisis. So, we have machinery, which has 70/80 different factors and hundreds of questions that we ask twice a year, to interrogate the performance of the institutions and to make sure that we are seeing them managing the issues that they're facing. So, it's not the challenges you face, it's the way you face your challenges\u2014it's a clich\u00e9\u2014and, at the moment, they are managing them, but if we were in any way concerned that they weren't, the people who are most at risk in that context are the students and we will be intervening to make sure that they were cited, and we do intervene when we have to.", "Angela Burns AM: Well, following on from what you said, I've just got two really specific technical questions, then, to ask, because you said that you look across the whole scope to make sure that they are meeting all of their correct liquidity ratios and so on. So, considering how much is invested in their estates, are you happy that each university's estates strategy and its financing is prudent and has appropriate governing-body oversight in place?", "Dr David Blaney: Yes, so the estates strategies that institutions operate are overseen by either the full governing body or relevant sub-committees in respect of every institution, so there is proper governance oversight. And in all of those instances, there is staff and student engagement as well in the strategic approach on estates. So, the machinery is in place\u2014", "Angela Burns AM: Because it's the big thing that drives most of university borrowing, isn't it?", "Dr David Blaney: Indeed, it is.", "Angela Burns AM: So, if our universities are on a sticky wicket, we just need to know that the borrowing that they're undertaking is absolutely prudently assessed and is appropriate. So, as long as you're content, if I can hear you say that\u2014[Laughter.]", "Dr David Blaney: Okay. We're content on two fronts: one is that the governance machinery within the institutions is structured appropriately to look at that, but also that if the institutions are wanting to engage in anything other than relatively trivial borrowing, they have to get our consent as well. And what we don't do is second-guess everything, but what we do do is make sure that the governing body, or its relevant committees, have been asking the right questions. So, there are two bits to this.", "Angela Burns AM: And then\u2014sorry.", "Bethan Owen: Can I just add to that, then?", "Angela Burns AM: Yes, of course.", "Bethan Owen: In asking for the forecasts, we have reinforced this year the importance of universities looking at different scenarios. So, to be looking at the demographic and maybe in the past, where there's potentially been growth in the system and universities have built that into their forecast, we have explicitly asked this year that we are provided\u2014not just the governing body\u2014with the scenario where there is no growth in the income. That's not the core forecast, but a scenario, so that it's quite clear how reliant the forecasts are on that growth, and if that growth doesn't come through, what the contingency plans are for ensuring that all the cost commitments can be met. And we should probably just differentiate between\u2014we have a role before borrowings are entered into, but all the best forecasts in the world can never quite predict, certainly what's happened in the last two years, probably, in universities. So, there are significant borrowings that are now committed to and the key measures we are looking at are universities' capacity to meet their covenants and their repayments under those borrowings, because that's essential for maintaining their liquidity.", "Angela Burns AM: Which actually, neatly, thank you, brings me to my last question, which is: have any universities broken those loan covenants or been close to breaking them, unable to pay their borrowings as and when they fall due?", "Bethan Owen: There was a significant change in accounting standards in 2015, financial reporting standard 102, so most universities had to renegotiate their covenants, but it was because the accounts were looking very different. The accounting standards brought about changes in how income was recognised and how some service concession arrangements, largely student accommodation arrangements, and pension costs, significantly, were recognised in the accounts. So, most universities have had to renegotiate covenants, but we're not aware of any who've had to renegotiate due to covenant breaches, other than one which the University of Wales Trinity Saint David disclosed in their financial statements\u2014that they did need to renegotiate their financing arrangements, which they have done earlier this year, and they have now negotiated new covenants. It's a core part of financial management in universities now that you manage your relationship with your lender as well as with us. Breaching covenants in themselves is different to doing that with your lender being unaware and the factors being within your control. So, again, from that perspective, we have the covenants built into our forecasts, we require the forecasts to show how the university are planning to be within their covenants. The nature of those covenants vary, but most of them require a measure of cash flow, a ratio between the cash generated and the cost of debt, so there is close monitoring that is required because of the borrowing in the system, as well as our ongoing monitoring as well.", "Angela Burns AM: Thank you, Bethan.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Just before we move on to Hefin David, can I just ask you what your view, then, is on the statement included by auditors in the accounts of Trinity Saint David that there is material uncertainty?", "Bethan Owen: Yes, I'll pick up on that. The material uncertainty largely relates\u2014there is a note in the accounts that explains the factors that are being taken into account, but it largely relates to some significant cash receipts that have been subject to timing delays and the fact that the timing of these is essentially outside the control of the institution. The main delay relates to the receipt of funding for the Egin project, which was due to be received from the Swansea city deal. That funding has been delayed, but the sums due to the university are still due to the university\u2014it's the issue of the timing of those receipts that is causing a cash pressure. Receipt of that funding would certainly reduce the cash flow pressure at the university at the moment. Just in terms of cash flows, all universities have to ensure that they are maintaining enough cash in their system to meet their payments as they fall due. Most of their costs are incurred on a monthly basis, staff costs in particular, but the income flows into universities are now less regular. In days gone by, that funding would largely flow from us and that would also come on a monthly basis. The funding from the Student Loans Company now, for example, comes in chunks. A quarter of that money comes in in October, a quarter in February, and the majority of it, half of it, doesn't come into the university in cash until May. So, that's quite a different cash management scenario for universities to manage; it requires holding cash balances to do it.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Just before I bring Hefin in, we're going to need to have a bit of agility, as Dai Lloyd would call it, in our questioning and our answers if we're going to cover the ground that we need to cover. So, Hefin.", "Hefin David AM: How can we be assured that governance arrangements across the eight institutions are sufficiently rigorous but also consistent?", "Dr David Blaney: So, the first point to make, of course, is that universities are autonomous, as you know\u2014", "Hefin David AM: I've just written 'independent and autonomous'.", "Dr David Blaney: Yes, all of that. And they are charities and so on, so they have expectations in respect of that in any case. The university governing body obviously is an important part of the machinery, particularly in terms of generating constructive challenge for the executive within universities. The governing bodies all are expected to behave in a way that is consistent with the guidance produced by the Committee of University Chairs, the CUC guide, which identifies good practice. So, it\u2019s a higher education code of governance and all Welsh universities work to that code. That code is itself up for review at the moment. So, that is an opportunity for that to be strengthened. Just in terms of governing bodies, it's also important that governing bodies engage in a process of continual refreshing, because that gives you a greater variety of perspectives, which is important. But it\u2019s also important they have people who understand the higher education business as well as from other contexts. Getting that mix right is important. As it happens at the moment, there are also issues about ethnicity and gender balance. Half the chairs of Welsh university governing bodies are female. Half the vice-chancellors are female. That\u2019s a positive position for Wales to be in. But I think our view would be that when you get an increase in the contextual pressures that we\u2019ve been discussing already this morning, the role of the governing body actually becomes even more significant. So, we have encouraged the sector, both the chairmen of the university councils, but also the vice-chancellors, to engage in a process of an independent review of governance in Wales. We\u2019ll be alongside that. We\u2019ll be supporting that. But, actually, it\u2019s important that they own it. And it hasn\u2019t been hard for us to encourage that\u2014they have been keen to take this opportunity to take stock. The Welsh higher education system is part of a UK system\u2014they don\u2019t want to be a million miles away from the rest of the UK in terms of expectations, but there is scope in Wales, given the scale of the sector, to actually construct something that is more challenging, I think, in terms of expectations, than might be the common denominator across the UK, and maybe some more exemplification. Importantly, in this exercise, we are not just interested in governance process. It\u2019s going to be quite hard to do this, but I\u2019m very keen that we engage\u2014and the sector are up for this\u2014in governance culture, because, actually, you can do process checks and you\u2019ll have the right structure of committees and have the right sort of papers going, but, in the end, it\u2019s the dynamic within that room and who\u2019s asking which questions and how well informed they are, and whether it's an open culture or is it a defensive culture\u2014these are really what influences the quality of decision making.", "Hefin David AM: And how different are those cultures across institutions?", "Dr David Blaney: I think it\u2019s very hard to say. We don\u2019t sit in the governing bodies of those institutions. Very occasionally we get to observe one. Typically, that\u2019s at a point where there are sufficient difficulties going on that we feel that we need to\u2014", "Hefin David AM: Do you have the option to observe at any point?", "Dr David Blaney: We can't insist, I don't think.", "Bethan Owen: We can ask to.", "Dr David Blaney: We can ask. But in the main, actually, our presence would change the dynamic of that anyway, so I'm not sure that's necessarily helpful. But we are keen to see what we can achieve with the sector in addressing these issues of what constitutes constructive challenge.", "Hefin David AM: I take from that that there might be different approaches in different institutions. Is your aim to see consistency in the same approaches, then?", "Dr David Blaney: I think we\u2019d like to see a consistent minimum set of expectations. I think there are differences, because there are people involved. In the end, it\u2019s about personalities, it\u2019s about people\u2019s background and it\u2019s about their knowledge. And we have a role to play in this as well, so we have a toolkit that we produce for governors, which, essentially, is a set of information that locates their university in the context of the UK, across a number of factors. So, if they had been told something that is not perhaps as true as it might be by the executive, they can see that in the data. Whether that toolkit needs a refresh\u2014I\u2019m sure it probably does, it\u2019s been there for a while now\u2014. So, part of that is what information we can provide to help governing bodies be properly informed as well.", "Hefin David AM: Yes, and this is the independence and autonomy thing. This is quite distant from Government\u2014unlike other institutions, where you can prescribe some of these approaches.", "Dr David Blaney: Yes, and in the end I don't think there's any pushback from the sector in terms of wanting to operate in accordance with best practice.", "Hefin David AM: Yes, and I totally defend independence and autonomy.", "Dr David Blaney: Absolutely. The challenge is all of us being clear what constitutes best practice.", "Hefin David AM: So, what about risk appetite? Do you feel that any governing bodies are exhibiting what might be considered to be an imprudent risk appetite?", "Dr David Blaney: I don't think so, and this manifests itself in two ways. So, we would see this coming through in forecasts, and we would see it coming through in requests for borrowings, predominantly. Actually, we'd see it in other ways as well. Our links into institutions are many and various, and we have our formal stuff, but we all have links into institutions that are informal and we\u2014. One of the beauties of the scale of the sector in Wales is we can see the institutions in a way that they can't hope to in England. It's just completely different. And so we would see it in other ways. But we have, in some instances, I think it's fair to say, helped institutions to think again about some of their aspirations. So, where we've seen things and we think, 'That just looks ridiculously optimistic,' we've just asked the questions. We don't say, 'No, you can't do that,' because they are autonomous, they make the decisions, but we try to make sure that they're asking the right questions.", "Hefin David AM: So, would you see that governing bodies are falling short in doing that themselves, in that, where they become strategic decisions that require due diligence, are the governing bodies themselves presenting that challenge? Or the fact you've just said that, does that suggest to us that, actually, they are falling short?", "Dr David Blaney: I think there's a mixture of things going on. We have a slightly different perspective and we have a perspective that is very intimately informed in terms of how the institution is performing. So, you have a governing body with a range of perspectives, and you will also have people who are very committed and very enthusiastic about the institution, and just occasionally it's helpful to get a slightly external perspective on these things. So, I don't think it's a shortfall as such, but I just think\u2014", "Hefin David AM: The kind of honest broker role, kind of.", "Dr David Blaney: The machinery depends on having a body like HEFCW doing some of that role, and the people who lend money to institutions are absolutely clear about that. So, we have relationships with the banks; they come and see us every now and again\u2014typically not to talk about individual clients but just to talk about what we do and how we do it. Interestingly, for example, when Michael Barber got up before Christmas and said there will be no bail-outs of universities, we had banks on the phone to us within a couple of days, wanting just to talk about how it is in Wales and is it still how it used to be. So, they are very keenly aware of what we do. So, it's not really a governance failure; it's just that the machinery includes us.", "Hefin David AM: Okay, that's important. And one of the things, from a distance\u2014I mean, I've been involved in different ways in an institution, and looking at the institutions from a distance. There are people, as you say, involved, and people always make the difference in different cultures. Do you find that the relationships between executive teams and governors is effective, and are they sufficiently robust and challenging as well? Those executive permanent staff and the governors\u2014is there challenge there?", "Dr David Blaney: I would say, in the main, yes. Occasionally, we help the governors to ask the right questions, so occasionally that external perspective we've just discussed is helpful in that regard. Actually, there are times when there are tensions between the executive and governing bodies, inevitably\u2014that's not something that's remarkable\u2014and we can feel that as well. We have conversations with both governing bodies and executives.", "Hefin David AM: And that can become apparent from a public point of view as well\u2014you know, media reports and\u2014.", "Dr David Blaney: Yes, sometimes these things can spill, and the governing bodies also include student representation, staff representation, who are typically union reps, and so, you know, there are all sorts of\u2014. I'm not in any way saying that people are indiscreet, but there are all sorts of interests that are sitting around that table that have to be managed within a governance context. So, sometimes it can spill. And these tensions are not all-out war, but there are sometimes differences of view and they have to be worked through, and that's governance working properly, I think.", "Hefin David AM: Okay, which is\u2014some of the work you've suggested will help towards that.", "Dr David Blaney: Yes.", "Hefin David AM: And a last question: you've identified one university as high risk, five as medium, and two as low in the short to medium term. You're obviously not going to tell us which, but what I'm interested in is the direction of travel, and whether those that are 'medium'\u2014are they at any point at risk of becoming 'high' in the near future?", "Dr David Blaney: I think it's fair to say that the direction of travel is that we're seeing an increased risk profile in the sector in Wales, and it's about the financial pressures that we've already discussed this morning. And that is why the efforts that the Minister has gone to to secure the Diamond settlement, and, indeed, other bits of money now and again, are so important. So, she's doing what she can, and that's really good, but we always knew that, between the point of the Diamond recommendations being made and the full implementation, there was going to be a valley to cross. The new machinery costs more as you phase out the old as well. So, the amount of funding was always going to be under pressure; there's a demographic dip, and there are the other contextual factors we've discussed. We always knew there was going to be a valley. And the institutions have been working very hard to try not to take cost out now that they really don't have to take out, because they don't want to reduce capacity, which they'll struggle to recover again when the financial position improves. So, they are seeing deficits, which are managed deficits, where they're spending more than their income in order just to keep the capacity in. So, they're being as responsible as we could expect them to be in this.", "Hefin David AM: And, if you're back in a year or two's time, the next few years, are we confident that there won't be more in the high-risk category? You said you don't see collapse, but are we confident there won't be more in the high-risk category?", "Dr David Blaney: Well, I think what I would always say about this process is that it doesn't guarantee 100 per cent accuracy. We can only go on what we can see. So, I wouldn't\u2014. HEFCW is innately cautious as an organisation, so I'm not going to say we're confident, but that doesn't mean to say we're worried either.", "Hefin David AM: Right, okay. So, to answer my question: are we likely to see more in the high-risk category or not?", "Dr David Blaney: We might.", "Hefin David AM: Okay.", "Bethan Owen: And, just to add, I think the key bit of that is maintaining the attractiveness of Welsh universities to students, because a large proportion are coming not from just Wales, but from England and internationally\u2014so, that's a key part\u2014and also that our research portfolio is invested in, and that also brings economic benefits. So, I think those are the two that we are [correction: need to be] able to maintain: the institutions as attractive options for students, and that our research capacity is invested in.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. I've got a supplementary from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Just in the interest of transparency, are you able to tell us which universities are in which categories of risk?", "Dr David Blaney: We don't publish that; we publish numbers. So, that's, I'm afraid, where we're going to stick.", "Hefin David AM: They didn't even try to\u2014[Inaudible.] [Laughter.]", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. The next questions then are from Janet Finch-Saunders.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Good morning. Can you explain your overall approach to the 2019-20 allocations and what your priority for allocations has been?", "Bethan Owen: We publish our funding allocations, and we published the 2019-20 allocations on 4 June. For 2019-20, we're allocating \u00a3149 million, and, as David said, this is the first year that we've been able to start putting funding, additional funding, in from the Diamond recommendations for investment in the sector. So, that means we've been able to increase our recurrent teaching funding by \u00a37 million\u2014not a significant amount, but it's a start. And we have maintained QR, which is our funding for research, quality research, and postgraduate research, at least at the same levels of \u00a376 million, as it's been that in previous years. We've increased part-time funding by \u00a31 million to \u00a326 million, and we've started to increase support for expensive subjects\u2014that's medicine, dentistry and conservatoire provision\u2014and higher cost subjects\u2014those are the sciences and the STEM. So, we made a start on that and increased that support by about \u00a36 million to \u00a320 million in total. And, in addition to that, we have strategic funding that we're maintaining for Reaching Wider projects and the S\u00ear Cymru project. And then, in addition to our recurrent funding, we have had strategic funding in our remit letters for the last two years. So, we're developing programmes for civic mission, community engagement, collaborations between higher education and further education, and, more recently, we had funding at the end of March to start to implement the recommendations of Graeme Reid's report for research investment, and also for developing mental health and well-being. That strategic funding is very welcome, but to be able to build those activities into our core funding, which we hope Diamond will bring, would be more sustainable for institutions.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Now, the Minister talks of one skills system. How do your allocations to the 2019-20 academic year support and incentivise collaboration between HE and FE?", "Dr David Blaney: So, there are probably two dimensions to this. First of all, we have provided \u00a33.5 million of separate funding specifically targeted to improve and increase collaboration between HE and FE. So, we put out a circular inviting proposals for that, and it was competitive, so we funded what was the best of the proposals, and we constrained it to be available only to pump-prime new activity or to add value to existing activity, but not just to keep things ticking over. We had seven bids submitted from across the three Welsh regions on a whole range of activities, which we probably haven't got time to go into now. I've got a long list here, but, for example, in south-east Wales, the University of South Wales is leading on a bid partnering with Cardiff University, Cardiff Met, with the Open University and all the FE players in the region. So, we were really pleased, actually. We tried to get it within regions, because that's how you get the biggest impact for learners in the area and also for smaller enterprises in terms of innovation work. So, that is a specific bit of funding designed to incentivise HE-FE\u00a0collaboration. And then we direct fund a couple of FE institutions for delivery of higher education for historical reasons, and we also have our funding going through to support franchise activity between HE and FE. There are about 5,000 students who are studying HE programmes under franchise in FE colleges in Wales, and our funding method has, historically for some time now, protected that money. So, we try to prevent universities from taking the money out of franchise and onto campus, because we think it's important to try to encourage local provision within particular localities. And, certainly in areas where public transport infrastructure is perhaps not what it might be, for people to move to universities can be quite a disincentive, so\u2014. But we encourage it that way as well.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Then, finally from me, the council's remit letter for the 2019-20 academic year from the Minister does ask you to consider how you'd increase openness and transparency around the use of fee income. So, what are the issues here, and how will you take this forward?", "Bethan Owen: The reporting of the income and expenditure is largely provided, probably more so in narrative form in the accounts and the financial statements and annual reports of institutions. A number of institutions also provide graphs and more easily accessible information to understand the income and expenditure of universities. But we would accept that this information isn't easy to access at the moment. There are examples of good practice across the sector in presenting as simply as possible what the income sources are for universities and how they spend their money. And we're going to be working with the Welsh universities and sector bodies to improve the accessibility of that information for Welsh institutions. More transparent reporting of income and expenditure, and not just fee income, is actually very important for understanding how income cross-flows work in universities. Some reasonably simplistic analyses can assume that all the student fee just covers the direct costs of academic provision, but there's much more to the student experience than that, so there are costs: there are the infrastructure costs, the student support costs, even the community engagement and all the research activities bring benefits to the teaching and fee provision. So, more transparency of all the universities' income sources and expenditure and a better understanding of the income cross-flows and why you can't look at universities in isolation of student provision and research, you have to look at the whole\u2014so, we'll be working with them to improve that information.", "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We're going to go to Hefin David now for some questions on part-time student funding.", "Hefin David AM: Part-time student numbers are bucking the trend in Wales, as I understand it, and we are seeing a bigger increase in Wales of part-time numbers than elsewhere in the UK. How is that going to be sustainable within current arrangements?", "Bethan Owen: We've allocated \u00a326.5 million in 2019-20\u00a0to support part-time provision, and we have been able in 2019-20 to fund some growth. So, there is growth in that funding to allow those institutions and incentivise those institutions who have recruited more students than last year to continue to do so. That came at an overall additional cost of \u00a31.9 million, and, based on what we're hearing from student support, we're expecting to see that requirement increase. So, it's one of the areas where we'll need to look at how we prioritise Diamond funding. And at the moment, our intention\u2014but subject to knowing the quantum of it\u2014is to continue to support and fund growth in part-time provision.", "Hefin David AM: So, is it possible\u2014? With the Welsh Government's policy of developing lifelong learning, is it possible that will be ever spread more thinly?", "Dr David Blaney: That is the challenge, and there's a piece of work that we have in our sights to look again at part-time and what it is and what the various drivers are. There's a temptation, I think, at times, to see it solely in terms of skills for an economy, and it is important for reskilling and upskilling, but actually, it's important for other things as well. If we see higher education solely in terms of skilling an economy, we've missed an important part of the contribution that higher education makes. But part-time is really quite difficult, because there's part-time that is about upskilling, part time that's about reskilling, there's part-time for social purposes, there's employer-supported part-time, there's student\u2014. So, there's a complexity there.", "Hefin David AM: But they are more reactive to rises in fees.", "Dr David Blaney: Well, there is a sense that they are more price sensitive, yes, and so the support regime that the Government is putting in place is important, and that probably has made a difference to the numbers of part-timers entering the system this last year. But I think we need to stake stock of what is important about part-time, what the market will deliver, what the market won't deliver, what we should fund and so on. And there's a complexity around all that, as I've indicated, which we need to do a bit of work on with the sector, with the student body as well, just to take some stock of this over the next year or so.", "Hefin David AM: Could we end up seeing significant fee increases for part-time students?", "Dr David Blaney: My sense is we won't. The Government wishes us to monitor, so we monitor, and that in itself is not straightforward, actually. But your comment about price sensitivity, I think, is really the nub of it. There's a limit to how much a fee increase would be acceptable to the part-time market. So, I think it's kind of self-regulating in that respect. I don't think we'll see massive fee increases; we might see a bit, but we won't see masses, I don't think.", "Hefin David AM: Okay.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We've got some questions now on funding for research and innovation, and also we'd like to talk a bit about a replacement for European Union funds. Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Thank you very much. If I could turn specifically to research, we know, of course, that both the Diamond and Reid reviews called for QR funding to be maintained in real terms, but the allocation is exactly the same for 2019-20 as it has been for the past nine years. Have you carried out any kind of assessment of the impact of this level of research funding on universities and, indeed, on the Welsh economy?", "Dr David Blaney: I'm sorry; I missed the beginning of that because I couldn't hear this headset.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Si\u00e2n, could you repeat the question? Sorry. We had a bit of a problem with translation at the beginning.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, no problem. I was talking about the Diamond and Reid reviews at the beginning of my question and the fact that they had recommended that QR funding should be maintained in real terms. But, of course, the sum hasn't actually increased over a period of nine years.", "Dr David Blaney: Okay. The reason the sum hasn't increased is because we haven't had enough money to be able to increase it and still meet the obligations we have to other bits of the HE system. We would dearly love to increase it. Both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid were very clear about the importance of being able to invest in our QR research funding, for a number of reasons. The capacity of the sector to be able to respond to funding opportunities elsewhere in the UK and across the rest of the world is itself determined by the size and the strength of the research base, which is sustained by QR funding. If they go for UK-based competitive research funding, that is typically constructed on the absolute assumption that QR will be part of that mix. So, they tend to fund to 80 per cent of the actual cost of the research, with the expectation that QR will plug the gap. And we know that, although the Welsh research base is extraordinarily productive, and really is punching above its weight in many ways\u2014and I mentioned earlier the impact of the research base in the last research excellence framework\u2014we know that, actually, it could do so much more, if it just had more scale. So, we fully endorse the reports from both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid that QR is important, and it's important also to be able to allow institutions to invest in research areas that emerge over time. It's almost impossible for a body like us, far less the Government, to know where these emerging strengths are going to come from, and QR provides the flexibility for institutions, which is absolutely fundamental to keeping the research base dynamic.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Therefore, you do have concerns that this isn't increasing\u2014you have that concern of a lack of increase in the level of investment. But has any particular assessment been made of the impact of not increasing that funding?", "Dr David Blaney: So, there is\u2014. Graeme Reid's report produced an assessment of the correlation between QR funding and capacity to generate funding from other sources, and there's a very close correlation\u2014", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Has HEFCW done any assessment to look at the effect of underfunding research, to all intents and purposes?", "Dr David Blaney: Not directly. We've relied on the expert assessment of people like Graeme Reid. It's sometimes more effective to have external experts making these points than us or the sector.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Your remit requires you to encourage universities to continue to develop one particular element of research, which is educational research. How does your allocation for 2019-20 contribute to that in terms of pedagogy and educational research specifically?", "Dr David Blaney: Bethan, did you want to say something on this?", "Bethan Owen: I was just going to add that, when we look at the funding that comes into our sector in Wales, compared with the rest of the UK, it's easy to see from the figures that our percentage of income that comes from research is smaller than in England, so the figures show that we receive less of the money that's available, which is a factor that results from us having less QR as a percentage, so we're in a situation where we get less of that UK funding that's available as well.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: So, there's a knock-on to that; that's what you're trying to say. But from the point of view of my question on educational research\u2014?", "Dr David Blaney: So, we have provided funding in 2017-18 and 2018-19 to WISERD Education, which is a research collaboration between a number of the Welsh universities, specifically looking at educational issues, and we're providing additional funding to that to add value to the Welsh Government's existing evaluation of the progress of pioneer schools in developing the three-to-15 curriculum in Wales. I won't go into the full detail of it now, but it's a five-partner project feeding into this with researchers from Cardiff, Cardiff Met, Trinity Saint David, Aber, Bangor and the University of South Wales. So, it's a collaborative effort, and we have, in the past, also funded WISERD Education, so it's an important research facility and increasingly being used, I'm delighted to say, by Welsh Government in underpinning its own policy thinking.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: And likewise, in 2019-20, there will be allocations specifically for this.", "Dr David Blaney: It's a bit early to say yet. We haven't allocated anything specifically in the main allocations that we've put out. There might be others to come, but we're not yet in a position to say.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. Well, could you provide the remit letter from\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014do that? You have to do everything in the remit letters.", "Dr David Blaney: We do what we can to pay due regard to the remit letters, as the wording goes. So, we have it in our sights, but we're not yet ready to make announcements.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: And then turning to the impact of the loss of funds were we to leave the European Union. Of course, this is going to have a far-reaching impact on future research, and the Reid review has made recommendations to mitigate this impact. So, what assessment have you made of how allocations will be able to help universities to transition away from EU funding?", "Dr David Blaney: So, again, the Reid review has done a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of an impact assessment for us. And we endorse, just as the Government has endorsed, the recommendations from Reid. The Government has committed in principle to delivering Reid. The challenge is finding the money, and we fully understand that. There has been an additional \u00a36.6 million allocated for research very recently by the Government, which we have put out specifically in line with some of the recommendations from Reid. So, that's a start, but that's not sustainable funding, and it's not enough, really, but it is a good and welcome start. Reid was also not just talking about the money, but also talking about the way in which the Welsh research base both represents itself and also engages with UK-wide developments. And in response to that, we have recently issued our own vision for research and innovation, which was developed over a number of months, following the Reid report closely, working with stakeholders, including the Welsh Government, in order to try and set a vision for how we respond to the challenges facing research in the future, including the reduction, potentially, of access to EU funds. And a lot of that is\u2014. These Reid recommendations all come together; they're coherent. A lot of that requires investment in the Welsh research base in order to be able to go for competitive funding at a UK level. Since it seems possible at least, and possibly even likely, that any money retrieved from not having to invest in the EU will sit in London rather than necessarily being devolved to the devolved administrations\u2014we understand fully the Welsh Government's position on that, and we don't disagree with it. But either way, we need a research base that's able to compete, and that's why the investment recommendations of Reid are so important.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. I think Reid was saying that there may be pots of money out there that aren't being accessed at the moment by Welsh universities. Are you able to help then within that process?", "Bethan Owen: One aspect that we do intend to fund\u2014and this is from Diamond, as well as Reid\u2014is to place funding back into the system for innovation. We're consulting currently, with the intention, if the funding is available to us, clearly, in the year 2020-21, to provide \u00a315 million back into the sector in innovation funding. That's funding that we had to take out when the new fee system came in. That is part of promoting the innovation, and part of the research portfolio as well.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Is that part of the UKRI funding? There is some \u00a37 billion in the hands of that organisation, as I understand it, and there may be some possibilities there too.", "Bethan Owen: That \u00a315 million will be money that comes from us, but the intention is that the money will go in in order to improve universities' ability to access that funding from UKRI. So, Innovate UK would be the part of UKRI\u2014and that we improve our ability to get funding from outside Wales. And, then, Graeme Reid says the same thing in terms of research\u2014that we need more funding to do the same thing there.", "Dr David Blaney: And, then, there's also the recommendation from Reid that Wales needs to be better embedded in the conversations that are going on on a UK-wide basis, so the Welsh Government has established a presence in London in respect of research, and we have a colleague in HEFCW who is fractionally embedded in the United Kingdom Research and Innovation specifically to respond to that recommendation. And that is actually paying dividends; we are strengthening our relationship with the UK machinery, which is essential if we're to understand where they're heading and what their funding bids are all about, and even to be able to influence those.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, Si\u00e2n?", "Sian Gwenllian AM: So, as far as research is concerned, it's not all doom and gloom.", "Dr David Blaney: Yes, I mean, you know, things are looking up. There is money coming in and if the Government, as it is able to, can find money and can invest in this area, then that will help.", "Sian Gwenllian AM: Thank you very much.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Just a couple of questions from me, then, before you close: what is your recent work on the 'basket of goods' show regarding student accommodation costs? And have any institutions used their 2019-20 fee and access plans to make commitments to more affordable accommodation for under-represented groups?", "Dr David Blaney: First of all, on the basket of goods, the work we're doing now\u2014we're currently in train in terms of analysing the data in respect of the basket of goods, so this is slightly premature, but our early look at the data indicates that there are no increases in costs, accommodation or other, that would cause us concern. So, it doesn't look like institutions are succumbing to the temptation to up their income streams from other costs. So, that's good. In terms of the fee and access plans, the sector has committed over \u00a328 million of investment in student support-related activities from the fee and access plans, and that includes, in many instances, bursaries that are designed to help students cope with the costs of accommodation and the cost of living more generally. The support is provided for a range of purposes, but a couple of examples, just very quickly: Trinity Saint David, since we've talked about them a lot today, they offer \u00a31,000 bursary to care leavers, which is in addition to local authority support for care leavers. Bangor also offer targeted support for care leavers, and these are often also extended, so they apply not just in term time, but throughout the holiday time as well, because people still need to live during the holidays. So, there is investment going in from the fee plans in that support.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. And just one final question from me then, going back to Trinity Saint David: are you concerned that the governing body of Trinity Saint David has taken decisions that have led to that material uncertainty, and is that unprecedented in Wales?", "Dr David Blaney: My view is that the decisions that the governing body made were, in our view, perfectly rational decisions to have made, given the information they had at the time. So, what's happened is that a number of unforeseen events have arisen, which, actually, I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to have foreseen, and it's just a combination of these that has caused the cash pressure. So, I don't see this as a governance failure, and they are engaging with those challenges.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you both for attending and for answering all our questions this morning? You did say that you would give the committee a note on reserves for the last four years, so we'd be grateful if we could receive that. And, as usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Thank you, again, for your time this morning.", "Dr David Blaney: Thank you.", "Bethan Owen: Thank you very much.", "Lynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Deputy Minister requesting further information for our scrutiny of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 2 is a letter from me to the Children's Commissioner for Wales also asking for further information to pursue our scrutiny of the Bill. And paper to note 3 is a letter to the Minister for Education asking for an update on the framework for young people educated other than at school. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you.

It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling .

We don't want wood .", "Project Manager: Yeah yeah yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , among the old people , yeah .", "Marketing: Old people . So , that's it for me .", "Project Manager: Alright . Nice , uh well  show us .", "Industrial Designer: Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design . Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties . This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device . And the materials ? Um I have heard several things , so I uh I'll have to change that on the way . But uh the case ? Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic . But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong .", "Marketing: Yeah , we should change that .", "Industrial Designer: It should feel strong . So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient .", "Project Manager: Well maybe it it it is ,", "Industrial Designer: We should move to uh something", "Project Manager: but it doesn't look strong . So maybe", "Industrial Designer: Well yeah . Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , but it doesn't have a really really tough look .

Mm-hmm . But we'll return to that .", "Project Manager: Yeah ?", "Industrial Designer: Uh the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees .

I think that's the best uh way to do it .", "Industrial Designer: And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb .", "Industrial Designer: Then I've uh  had a few findings , made a few findings . Uh the target audience product style . Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like , as you said , uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that .

Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: But they like soft materials , uh so we might uh we have to consider that . And also they like curved round shapes . So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device .

Mm .", "Project Manager: Huh ?", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Project Manager: That's nice .", "User Interface: Hmm .", "Project Manager: All the  results ?", "Industrial Designer: Well I also have um several examples of uh styles ,", "Marketing: We keep coming back to the fronts .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Uh  these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: It was not very uh interesting uh , very classical looking ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .  Nai . Uh no .", "Industrial Designer: but that's n that's not what we want .", "User Interface: Hmm .", "Industrial Designer: We have these kind of things . I don't know what exactly they are .", "Marketing: Fruity .  Fruity .", "Industrial Designer: It looks like  Well you know uh you recognise the shapes ,", "Industrial Designer: it's very primary colours , uh bright colours and uh round shapes .", "Industrial Designer: You also uh  see uh this device , it's not very round and  Fruity of course . Yeah , it uh", "Project Manager: It's t terrible .", "Industrial Designer: That's true .", "Project Manager: Alright .", "Industrial Designer: And uh well round shapes , primary colours .", "Industrial Designer: You can see it all here . And of course uh this famous device .", "Project Manager: Hmm ?", "Industrial Designer: I think as you know something uh some devices like this .", "Project Manager: Yeah , alright .", "Industrial Designer: So to give you an idea of uh", "Marketing: Well it's got a strong look , this . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: This has a strong look . Although it's plastic , it's it's grey to to to give it iron look .", "Marketing: Yeah , it still has a strong look .", "Project Manager: Yeah . And it's round .", "Industrial Designer: That's uh", "Marketing: But then you are losing your fruity colours .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Well we have to make a", "Project Manager: Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . So uh those kind of things you can you can combine .", "Marketing: That's true .", "Industrial Designer: Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control . I don't think that's very practical ,", "Project Manager: No , it isn't .", "Industrial Designer: but  But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger .", "Project Manager: Yes .", "Industrial Designer: 'Cause if you look at this , it it doesn't look very very strong ,", "Marketing: Yeah but the", "Industrial Designer: becau But this is plastic , and and this too , but", "Marketing: But it doesn't have to look strong . The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy .", "Industrial Designer: The feel ? Uh alright .", "Marketing: The feel .", "Project Manager: So , if you ti", "Industrial Designer: Well", "User Interface: And it it doesn't have to be strong , also .", "Project Manager: Well", "Marketing: Nah yeah the feel", "Project Manager: You you  Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something .", "User Interface: Only the feel .", "Project Manager: So it it looks pretty but it feels strong .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Right .", "User Interface: Oh .", "Industrial Designer: And I  Then I have some more findings . Um  uh about the energy energy source of the of the device ,", "Marketing: I agree .", "Industrial Designer: uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun .", "Industrial Designer: And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote ,", "Industrial Designer: that's a bit , oh , that's a bit uh  That's a bit uh much .", "Project Manager: No titanium .", "Industrial Designer: And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case .", "Industrial Designer: Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . That that's the information I received . If you use the curved case , uh a curved case , double curved then you can't use titanium .", "Project Manager: What do you exactly mean with double curved ?", "Industrial Designer: Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look .", "Industrial Designer: And uh  now the the shape , yeah ,  a curved case . Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . Uh  a more modern look not plain , long box style , but", "Marketing: I dunno .", "Project Manager: Double curved ?", "Industrial Designer: I'll draw it ,", "Project Manager: It it mean", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah , well okay .", "Industrial Designer: but maybe later .", "Industrial Designer: And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have uh  . Um anyway", "Industrial Designer: Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive . And , uh as we agreed , we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um  uh speak uh speech uh controlled  device .", "Marketing: Yeah right .", "Industrial Designer: Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . But we do use an LCD screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive .

Right . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Uh soft enough .", "Marketing: Yeah . Right .", "Industrial Designer: So that's uh basically what I want to talk about .", "Project Manager: Alright . Okay . We will take that . And then uh Mike ? Okay .", "User Interface: Yeah . Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier . Um an LCD s screen will be implemented . Um we must decide where , this meeting .", "User Interface: Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems ,  um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . And um well they're cheap , so we could use them now .", "Project Manager: Oh  That's interesting .", "User Interface: Um it's not really speech recognition , it's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that .", "Industrial Designer: Oh , yeah , I understand . Yeah .", "Marketing: Oh okay .", "Project Manager: Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function .", "Marketing: Right .", "User Interface: No it doesn't does not do anything .", "Marketing: No .", "Project Manager: Oh . That's a bit uh", "User Interface: But i it's just a", "Marketing: But that that makes it cheap .", "Project Manager: Yes . I understand .", "User Interface: Yeah it's it's cheap .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: It's  it's just a an extra function ,", "Project Manager: But  it has no functionality for our remote at all .", "Marketing: and it's cheap .", "User Interface: No", "Marketing: No but", "User Interface: but that's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks .", "Marketing: Yeah , right .", "Industrial Designer: But it it's n nice for young people .", "Marketing: Young people love them .", "User Interface: Yes , we we should really uh include that one , I think . Um", "Industrial Designer: They like gadgets . Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah , ple Right .", "Project Manager: Hmm .", "Industrial Designer: If it's cheap . Yeah .", "User Interface: Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh LCD screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote .", "User Interface: Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and  uh and that kind of stuff", "User Interface: um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the LCD screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons .", "Project Manager: So you put a menu in the LCD ?", "User Interface: I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that . Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable . A voice recognition can be uh implemented . And uh I drew an example ,", "User Interface: but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do .", "Marketing: Alright .", "Industrial Designer: Can you draw it now of uh", "Marketing: How  How", "Project Manager: Ah .", "User Interface: Hmm ? Well I have the  I can draw it again ,", "Industrial Designer: Can you draw it now ?", "User Interface: and I know what I did wrong . I didn't tick the note bo box in the  . Um", "Industrial Designer: Mm . Alright .", "Marketing: How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the LCD screen ?", "User Interface: Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the", "Marketing: Alright . So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down .", "Project Manager: But then we should also have an uh an Okay button .", "User Interface: Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen . Yes .", "Marketing: Yeah right .", "User Interface: Um I shall draw this . If it uh works .", "Industrial Designer: button , yeah .", "Project Manager: Just uh   There is already a blank . Yes ?

And in some ways it 's  it 's  it 's very similar to  There are very few changes in some ways from what we 've , um , uh , b done before but I don't think everyone here has seen all of this . So , uh , I 'm not sure where to begin . Um , as usual the disclaimers are there are  all these things are  it 's only slightly more stable than it was before .", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: And , um , after a little bit more discussion and especially like Keith and I  I have more linguistic things to settle in the next few days , um , it 'll probably change again some more .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Grad F: Um , maybe I will  let 's start b let 's start on number two actually on the notation , um , because that 's , I 'm thinking , possibly a little more familiar to , um  to people . OK , so the top block is just sort of a  sort of abstract nota it 's sort of like , um , listings of the kinds of things that we can have . And certain things that have , um , changed , have changed back to this . There  there 's been a little bit of , um , going back and forth . But basically obviously all constructions have some kind of name . I forgot to include that you could have a type included in this line .", "Professor C: What I was gonna  Right .", "Grad F: So something like , um  Well , there 's an example  the textual example at the end has clausal construction . So , um , just to show it doesn't have to be beautiful It could be , you know , simple old text as well . Um , there are a couple of  Uh , these three have various ways of doing certain things . So I 'll just try to go through them . So they could all have a type at the beginning . Um , and then they say the key word construction", "Professor C: Oh , I see .", "Grad F: and they have some name .", "Professor C: So  so the current syntax is if it s if there 's a type it 's before construct", "Grad F: Yeah , right .", "Professor C: OK , that 's fine .", "Grad F: OK , and then it has a block that is constituents . And as usual I guess all the constructions her all the examples here have only , um , tsk  one type of constituent , that is a constructional constituent . I think that 's actually gonna turn out to m be certainly the most common kind . But in general instead of the word \" construct \" , th here you might have \" meaning \" or \" form \" as well . OK ? So if there 's some element that doesn't  that isn't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning . OK , um , the main change with the constructs which  each of which has , um , the key word \" construct \" and then some name , and then some type specification , is that it 's  it 's pro it 's often  sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is . So for example whatever I have here is gonna be a form of the word \" throw \" , or it 's gonna be a form of the word , you know , I don't know , \" happy \" , or something like that . Or , you know , some it 'll be a specific word or maybe you 'll have the type . You 'll say \" I need a p uh spatial relation phrase here \" or \" I need a directional specifier here \" . So - uh you could have a j a actual type here . Um , or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type . So a very common example of this is that , you know , in directed motion , the first person to do something should be an agent of some kind , often a human . Right ? So if I  you know , the um , uh , run down the street then I  I  I run down the street , it 's typed , uh , \" I \" , meaning category is what 's there . The  the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair and , um , sort of skipping fonts and whatever . The idea is that sometimes there are , um , general constructions that you know , that you 're going to need . It 's  it 's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase , or something like that there .", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: And usually it has formal um , considerations that will go along with it .", "Professor C: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: And then uh , you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you 're talking about , about what meaning  what specific meaning you want . So the example again at the bottom , which is directed motion , you might need a nominal expression to take the place of , you know , um , \" the big th \" , you you know , \" the big  the tall dark man \" , you know , \" walked into the room \" .", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: But because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it 's nominal of some kind but in particular , that it 's some kind of animate nominal , and which will apply just as well to like , you know , a per you know , a simple proper noun or to some complicated expression . Um , so I don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types . So . OK , then I don't think the ,  um  at least  Yeah .  None of these examples have anything different for formal constraints ? But you can refer to any of the , um , sort of available elements and scope , right ? which here are the constructs ,  to say something about the relation . And I think i if you not if you compare like the top block and the textual block , um , we dropped like the little F subscript . The F subscripts refer to the \" form \" piece of the construct .", "Professor C: Good .", "Grad F: And I think that , um , in general it 'll be unambiguous . Like if you were giving a formal constraint then you 're referring to the formal pole of that . So  so by saying  if I just said \" Name one \" then that means name one formal and we 're talking about formal struc  Which  which makes sense . Uh , there are certain times when we 'll have an exception to that , in which case you could just indicate \" here I mean the meaningful for some reason \" . Right ? Or  Actually it 's more often that , only to handle this one special case of , you know , \" George and Jerry walk into the room in that order \" .", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: So we have a few funny things where something in the meaning might refer to something in the form . But  but s we 're not gonna really worry about that for right now and there are way We can be more specific if we have to later on . OK , and so in terms of the  the relations , you know , as usual they 're before and ends . I should have put an example in of something that isn't an interval relation but in form you might also have a value binding . You know , you could say that , um , you know , \" name - one dot \" , t you know , \" number equals \" , you know , a plural or something like that .", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: There are certain things that are attribute - value , similar to the bindings below but I mean they 're just  us usually they 're going to be value  value fillers , right ? OK , and then again semantic constraints here are just  are just bindings . There was talk of changing the name of that . And Johno and I  I  you  you and I can like fight about that if you like ? but about changing it to \" semantic  n effects \" , which I thought was a little bit too order - biased", "Grad B: Well  Th", "Grad F: and \" semantic bindings \" , which I thought might be too restrictive in case we don't have only bindings . And so it was an issue whether constraints  um , there were some linguists who reacted against \" constraints \" , saying , \" oh , if it 's not used for matching , then it shouldn't be called a constraint \" . But I think we want to be uncommitted about whether it 's used for matching or not . Right ? Cuz there are  I think we thought of some situations where it would be useful to use whatever the c bindings are , for actual , you know , sort of like modified constraining purposes .", "Professor C: Well , you definitely want to de - couple the formalism from the parsing strategy . So that whether or not it 's used for matching or only for verification , I", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Grad F: Yeah , yeah . It 's used shouldn't matter , right ? Mm - hmm .", "Professor C: s For sure . I mean , I don't know what , uh , term we want to use", "Grad F: Mm - hmm .", "Professor C: but we don't want to", "Grad F: Yeah , uh , there was one time when  when Hans explained why \" constraints \" was a misleading word for him .", "Professor C: Yep .", "Grad F: And I think the reason that he gave was similar to the reason why Johno thought it was a misleading term , which was just an interesting coincidence . Um , but , uh  And so I was like , \" OK , well both of you don't like it ?", "Professor C: It 's g it 's gone .", "Grad F: Fine , we can change it \" . But I  I  I 'm starting to like it again .", "Grad B: But", "Grad F: So that that 's why   That 's why I 'll stick with it .", "Grad A: Well , you know what ?", "Grad F: So", "Grad A: If you have an \" if - then \" phrase , do you know what the \" then \" phrase is called ?", "Professor C: Th", "Grad F: What ? Con - uh , a consequent ?", "Grad A: Yeah .", "Grad F: Yeah , but it 's not an \" if - then \" .", "Grad A: No , but", "Professor C: I know . Anyway , so the other  the other strategy you guys could consider is when you don't know what word to put , you could put no word ,", "Grad F: Mm - hmm .", "Professor C: just meaning . OK ? And the then let", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Grad F: Yeah , that 's true .", "Grad B: So that 's why you put semantic constraints up top and meaning bindings down  down here ?", "Grad F: Oh , oops ! No . That was just a mistake of cut and paste from when I was going with it .", "Grad B: OK .", "Professor C: OK .", "Grad F: So , I 'm sorry . I didn't mean  that one 's an in unintentional .", "Grad B: So this should be semantic and", "Grad F: Sometimes I 'm intentionally inconsistent", "Grad F: cuz I 'm not sure yet . Here , I actually  it was just a mistake .", "Grad B: Th - so this definitely should be \" semantic constraints \" down at the bottom ?", "Grad E: Sure .", "Grad F: Yeah .", "Grad B: OK .", "Grad F: Well , unless I go with \" meaning \" but i I mean , I kind of like \" meaning \" better than \" semantic \"", "Grad B: Or", "Professor C: Oh , whatever .", "Grad F: but I think there 's  vestiges of other people 's biases .", "Professor C: Or  wh That - b", "Grad F: Like", "Professor C: Right . Minor  min problem", "Grad F: Minor point .", "Professor C: OK .", "Grad E: Extremely .", "Grad F: OK , um , so I think the middle block doesn't really give you any more information , ex than the top block . And the bottom block similarly only just illus you know , all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and  and that you can drop the , um  uh , that you can give dual types . Oh , one thing I should mention is about \" designates \" . I think I 'm actually inconsistent across these as well . So , um , strike out the M subscript on the middle block .", "Professor C: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: So basically now , um , this is actually  this little change actually goes along with a big linguistic change , which is that \" designates \" isn't only something for the semantics to worry about now .", "Professor C: Good .", "Grad F: So we want s \" designates \" to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects but is sort of , um , really important for say composition later on . So for instance , if some other construction says , you know , \" are you of type  is this part of type whatever \" , um , the \" designates \" tells you which sort of part is the meaning part . OK , so if you have like \" the big red ball \" , you know , you wanna know if there 's an object or a noun . Well , ball is going to be the designated sort of element of that kind of phrase .", "Grad E: Mmm .", "Grad F: Um , there is a slight complication here which is that when we talk about form it 's useful sometimes to talk about , um  to talk about there also being a designated object and we think that that 'll be the same one , right ?

For us , um  OK , so how is it", "Professor C: Does that  Is that really what they mean in  in", "Grad F: so \" designate \"  FrameNet ?", "Professor C: I didn't know that .", "Grad F: FrameNet ? Yeah , yeah . I  I mean , I  I was a little bit surprised about it too .", "Professor C: Yeah .", "Grad F: I knew that  I thought that that would be something like  there 's another term that I 've heard for that thing", "Professor C: Right , OK .", "Grad F: but they  I mean  uh , well , at least Hans says they use it that way .

We don't have a notation for it but we might want one . So for example we 've talked about if you 're talking about the lexical item \" walk \" , you know it 's an action . Well , it also has this idea  it carries along with it the idea of an actor or somebody 's gonna do the walking . Or if you talk about an adjective \" red \" , it carries along the idea of the thing that has the property of having color red . So we used to use the notation \" with \" for this", "Professor C: Right .", "Grad F: and I think that 's closest to their second one .

Great .", "Grad F: Um , the I w I would just s some of this is just like my  you know , by fiat . I 'm going to say , this is how we use these terms . I don't - you know , there 's lots of different ways in the world that people use it .", "Professor C: I  that 's fine .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Grad F: I think that , um , the other terms that are related are like focus and stress .", "Professor C: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: So , s I think that the way I  we would like to think , uh , I think is focus is something that comes up in , I mean , lots of  basically this is the information structure .", "Professor C: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: OK , it 's like  uh , it 's not  it might be that there 's a syntactic , uh , device that you use to indicate focus or that there are things like , you know , I think Keith was telling me ,  things toward the end of the sentence , post - verbal , tend to be the focused  focused element ,", "Grad E: Mmm .", "Grad F: the new information . You know , if I  \" I walked into the room \" , you  tend to think that , whatever , \" into the room \" is sort of like the more focused kind of thing .", "Grad E: Mm - hmm . Yeah .", "Grad F: And when you , uh , uh , you have stress on something that might be , you know , a cue that the stressed element , or for instance , the negated element is kind of related to information structure . So that 's like the new  the sort of like import or whatever of  of this thing . Uh , so  so I think that 's kind of nice to keep \" focus \" being an information structure term . \" Stress \"  I th and then there are different kinds of focus that you can bring to it .

But it did  one  one implication it does f have for the other side , which we 'll get to in a minute is that I couldn't think of a good way to say \" here are the possible things that you could focus on \" , cuz it seems like any entity in any sentence , you know , or any meaning component of anyth you know  all the possible meanings you could have , any of them could be the subject of focus .", "Professor C: Mmm .", "Grad F: But I think one  the one thing you can schematize is the kind of focus , right ?

So , um , it 's  it is kind of like a profile  profile - background thing but I  I can't think of like the limited set of possible meanings that you would  that you would focu", "Grad E: Light up with focus , yeah .", "Grad F: light  highlight as opposed to other ones . So it has some certain complications for the , uh , uh  later on . Li - I mean , uh , the best thing I can come up with is that information has a list of focused elements .

So that 's onl there are  there are many more things that are uncl that are sort of like a little bit unstable about the notation but it 's most  I think it 's  this is , you know , the current  current form .

In  in real speech , um , people may put stress . It 's so d context dependent on what was there before , phrase ba breaks , um , restarts .", "Grad F: Yeah .

It 's complicated .", "Grad F: OK ,", "Grad A: And all", "Grad E: Yeah , I mean , I  I 'm sort of inclined to say let 's worry about specifying the information structure focus of the sentence", "Grad F: I believe you , yeah .", "Grad E: and then ,", "Grad F: Mm - hmm . Ways that you can get it come from th", "Grad E: hhh ,  the phonology component can handle actually assigning an intonation contour to that .", "Grad F: right .", "Grad E: You know , I mean , later on we 'll worry about exactly how", "Grad A: Or  or map from the contour to  to what the focus exponent is .", "Grad E: y Yeah . Exactly .", "Grad F: Mm - hmm .", "Grad E: But figure out how the", "Grad A: But , uh , if you don't know what you 're  what you 're focus is then you 're  you 're hopeless - uh - ly lost anyways ,", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Grad F: Right . That 's fine , yeah . Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: and the only way of figuring out what that is ,  is , um , by sort of generating all the possible alternatives to each focused element , decide which one in that context makes sense and which one doesn't .", "Grad F: Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: And then you 're left with a couple three . So , you know , again , that 's something that h humans can do ,", "Grad F: Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: um , but far outside the scope of  of any  anything . So . You know . It 's", "Grad F: OK . Well , uh , yeah , I wouldn't have assumed that it 's an easy problem in  in absence of all the oth", "Grad A: u u", "Grad F: you need all the other information I guess .", "Grad A: But it 's  it 's  what it  uh , it 's pretty easy to put it in the formalism , though .

Exactly . So the sort of effect of it is something we want to be able to capture .", "Professor C: Yeah , so b b but I think the poi I 'm not sure I understand but here 's what I th think is going on . That if we do the constructions right when a particular construction matches , it  the fact that it matches , does in fact specify the focus .", "Grad F: W uh , I 'm not sure about that .", "Professor C: OK .", "Grad F: Or it might limit  it cert certainly constrains the possibilities of focus .", "Professor C: Uh  k uh , at at the very least it constrai", "Grad F: I think that 's  that 's , th that 's certainly true . And depending on the construction it may or may not f specify the focus , right ?", "Professor C: Oh , uh , for sure , yes . There are constrai yeah , it 's not every  but there are constructions , uh , where you t explicitly take into account those considerations", "Grad F: Yeah . Mm - hmm .", "Professor C: that you need to take into account in order to decide which  what is being focused .", "Grad F: Mm - hmm .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .

Yeah , all  all of those .", "Grad A: All of these", "Professor C: Yeah .", "Grad F: Right .", "Grad A: and will we have  u is it all the same constructions ?

So that 's why I was talking about overlapping constructions . So , then you have a separate thing that picks out , you know , stress on something relative to everything else .", "Professor C: Yeah . So , the question is actually", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Professor C: oh , I 'm sorry ,", "Grad F: And it would", "Professor C: go ahead ,", "Grad F: yeah ,", "Professor C: finish .", "Grad F: and it w and that would have to  uh it might be ambiguous as , uh , whether it picks up that element , or the phrase , or something like that . But it 's still is limited possibility .", "Grad A: Hmm .", "Grad F: So that should , you know , interact with  it should overlap with whatever other construction is there .", "Grad A: Yeah .", "Professor C: S s the question is , do we have a way on the other page , uh , when we get to the s semantic side , of saying what the stressed element was , or stressed phrase , or something .", "Grad F: Mm - hmm . Well , so that 's why I was saying how  since I couldn't think of an easy like limited way of doing it , um , all I can say is that information structure has a focused slot", "Professor C: Right .", "Grad F: and I think that should be able to refer to", "Professor C: So that 's down at the bottom here when we get over there . OK .", "Grad F: Yeah , and , infer  and I don't have  I don't have a great way or great examples", "Professor C: I 'll - I 'll wait . OK .", "Grad F: but I think that  something like that is probably gonna be , uh , more  more what we have to do .", "Grad A: Hmm .", "Professor C: OK .", "Grad F: But , um ,", "Grad A: So", "Grad F: OK , that was one comment . And you had another one ?", "Grad A: Yeah , well the  once you know what the focus is the  everything else is background . How about \" topic - comment \" that 's the other side of information .", "Grad F: How about what ?", "Grad A: Topic - comment .", "Grad F: Yeah , so that was the other thing . And so I didn't realize it before . It 's like , \" oh ! \" It was an epiphany that it  you know , topic and focus are a contrast set . So topic is  Topic - focused seems to me like , um , background profile , OK , or a landmark trajector , or some something like that . There 's  there 's definitely , um , that kind of thing going on .", "Grad A: Mmm .", "Grad F: Now I don't know whether  I n I don't have as many great examples of like topic - indicating constructions on like focus , right ? Um , topic  it seems kind of  you know , I think that might be an ongoing kind of thing .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad E: Japanese has this though . You know .", "Grad F: Topic marker ?", "Grad A: Yeah .", "Grad E: Yeah , that 's what \" wa \" is , uh , just to mark which thing is the topic .", "Grad F: Mm - hmm .", "Grad E: It doesn't always have to be the subject .", "Grad F: Mm - hmm . Right . So again , information structure has a topic slot . And , you know , I stuck it in thinking that we might use it .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: Um , I think I stuck it in .", "Professor C: Yep , it 's there .", "Grad F: Um , and one thing that I didn't do consistently , um , is  when we get there , is like indicate what kind of thing fits into every role . I think I have an idea of what it should be but th you know , so far we 've been getting away with like either a type constraint or , um , you know , whatever . I forg it 'll be a frame . You know , it 'll be  it 'll be another predication or it 'll be , um , I don't know , some value from  from some something , some variable and scope or something like that , or a slot chain based on a variable and scope . OK , so well that 's  should we flip over to the other side officially then ?", "Grad A: Mm - hmm , hmm .", "Grad E: OK , side one .", "Grad F: I keep , uh , like , pointing forward to it . Yeah . Now we 'll go back to s OK , so this doesn't include something which mi mi may have some effect on  on it , which is , um , the discourse situation context record , right ? So I didn't  I  I meant just like draw a line and like , you know , you also have , uh , some tracking of what was going on .", "Professor C: Right .", "Grad F: And sort of  this is a big scale comment before I , you know , look into the details of this . But for instance you could imagine instead of having  I  I changed the name of  um it used to be \" entities \" . So you see it 's \" scenario \" , \" referent \" and \" discourse segment \" . And \" scenario \" is essentially what kind of  what 's the basic predication , what event happened . And actually it 's just a list of various slots from which you would draw  draw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ? Um , and obviously there are other ones that are not included here , general cultural frames and general like , uh , other action f", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: you know , specific X - schema frames . OK , whatever . The middle thing used to be \" entities \" because you could imagine it should be like really a list where here was various information . And this is intended to be grammatically specifiable information about a referent  uh , you know , about some entity that you were going to talk about . So \" Harry walked into the room \" , \" Harry \" and \" room \" , you know , the room  th but they would be represented in this list somehow . And it could also have for instance , it has this category slot . Um , it should be either category or in or instance . Basically , it could be a pointer to ontology . So that everything you know about this could be  could be drawn in . But the important things for grammatical purposes are for  things like number , gender , um  ki the ones I included here are slightly arbitrary but you could imagine that , um , you need to figure out wheth if it 's a group whether , um , some event is happening , linear time , linear spaces , like , you know , are  are they doing something serially or is it like , um , uh I 'm  I 'm not sure . Because this partly came from , uh , Talmy 's schema and I 'm not sure we 'll need all of these actually . But  Um , and then the \" status \" I used was like , again , in some languages , you know , like for instance in child language you might distinguish between different status . So , th the  the big com and  and finally \" discourse segment \" is about  sort of speech - act - y information structure - y , like utterance - specific kinds of things . So the comment I was going to make about , um , changing entity  the entity 's block to reference is that  you can imagine your discourse like situation context , you have a set of entities that you 're sort of referring to . And you might  that might be sort of a general , I don't know , database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to . And I changed to \" reference \" cuz I would say , for a particular utterance you have particular referring expressions in it . And those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here . For instance , I know it 's going to be plural . I know it 's gonna be feminine or something like that . And  and these could actually just point to , you know , the  the ID in my other list of enti active entities , right ? So , um , uh , th there 's  there 's all this stuff about discourse status . We 've talked about . I almost listed \" discourse status \" as a slot where you could say it 's active . You know , there 's this , um , hierarchy  uh there 's a schematization of , you know , things can be active or they can be , um , accessible , inaccessible .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Grad F: It was the one that , you know , Keith , um , emailed to us once , to some of us , not all of us . And the thing is that that  I noticed that that , um , list was sort of discourse dependent . It was like in this particular set , s you know , instance , it has been referred to recently or it hasn't been ,", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Grad F: or this is something that 's like in my world knowledge but not active .", "Professor C: This  Uh  yeah , well there  there seems to be context properties .", "Grad F: So .", "Professor C: Yeah .", "Grad F: Yeah , they 're contex and for instance , I used to have a location thing there but actually that 's a property of the situation . And it 's again , time , you know  at cert certain points things are located , you know , near or far from you", "Professor C: Well , uh , uh , this is recursive", "Grad F: and", "Professor C: cuz until we do the uh , mental space story , we 're not quite sure   Th - th", "Grad F: Yeah .", "Professor C: which is fine . We 'll just  we 'll j", "Grad F: Yeah , yeah . So some of these are , uh", "Professor C: we just don't know yet .", "Grad F: Right . So I  so for now I thought , well maybe I 'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance , right ? Everything else here is utterance - specific . Um , and I left the slot , \" predications \" , open because you can have , um , things like \" the guy I know from school \" .", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: Or , you know , like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na amounts of prep you know , predications that you might make . And it 's unclear whether  I mean , you could just have in your scenario , \" here are some extra few things that are true \" , right ?", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: And then you could just sort of not have this slot here . Right ? You 're  but  but it 's used for identification purposes .", "Professor C: Right .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Grad F: So it 's  it 's a little bit different from just saying \" all these things are true from my utterance \" .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Grad F: Um .", "Grad E: Right , \" this guy I know from school came for dinner \" does not mean , um , \" there 's a guy , I know him from school , and he came over for dinner \" . That 's not the same effect .", "Grad F: Yeah , it 's a little bit  it 's a little bit different . Right ? So  Or maybe that 's like a restrictive , non - restrictive", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Grad F: you know , it 's like it gets into that kind of thing for  um , but maybe I 'm mixing , you know  this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence .", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: So you might imagine that the information you pass to , you know  in identifying a particular referent would be , \" oh , some  \" you know , \" it 's a guy and it 's someone I know from school \" .", "Grad E: Yeah .", "Grad F: So maybe that would , you know , be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc to the , whatever , construal engine or whatever , discourse context , to find  you know , either create this reference ,", "Grad E: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: in which case it 'd be created here , and  you know , so  so you could imagine that this might not  So , uh , I 'm uncommitted to a couple of these things .", "Grad A: But  to make it m precise at least in my mind , uh , it 's not precise .", "Grad F: Um .", "Grad A: So \" house \" is gender neuter ? In reality", "Grad F: Um , it could be in", "Grad A: or in", "Professor C: Semantically .", "Grad A: semantically .", "Grad F: semantically , yeah . Yeah .", "Grad A: So", "Grad F: So it uh , uh , a table . You know , a thing that c doesn't have a gender . So . Uh , it could be that  I mean , maybe you 'd  maybe not all these  I mean , I wou I would say that I tried to keep slots here that were potentially relevant to most  most things .", "Grad A: No , just to make sure that we  everybody that 's  completely agreed that it  it has nothing to do with , uh , form .", "Grad F: Yeah . OK , that is semantic as opposed to  Yeah . Yeah . That 's right . Um .", "Grad A: Then \" predications \" makes sense to  to have it open for something like , uh , accessibility or not .", "Grad F: S so again  Open to various things .", "Grad A: Yeah .", "Grad F: Right . OK , so . Let 's see . So maybe having made that big sca sort of like large scale comment , should I just go through each of these slots  uh , each of these blocks , um , a little bit ?", "Grad E: Sure .", "Grad F: Um , mostly the top one is sort of image schematic . And just a note , which was that , um  s so when we actually ha so for instance , um , some of them seem more inherently static , OK , like a container or sort of support - ish . And others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic like \" source , path , goal \" is often thought of that way or \" force \" , or something like that . But in actual fact , I think that they 're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that . And different X - schemas use them in a way that 's either static or dynamic . So \" path \" , you could just be talking about the path between this and this .", "Grad E: Mmm .", "Grad F: And you know , \" container \" that you can go in and out . All of these things . And so , um , I think this came up when , uh , Ben and I were working with the Spaniards , um , the other day  the \" Spaniettes \" , as we  called them  um , to decide like how you want to split up , like , s image schematic contributions versus , like , X - schematic contributions . How do you link them up . And I think again , um , it 's gonna be something in the X - schema that tells you \" is this static or is this dynamic \" . So we definitely need  that sort of aspectual type gives you some of that . Um , that , you know , is it , uh , a state or is it a change of state , or is it a , um , action of some kind ?", "Grad A: Uh , i i i is there any meaning to when you have sort of parameters behind it and when you don't ?", "Grad F: Uh . Yeah .", "Grad A: Just means", "Grad F: Oh , oh ! You mean , in the slot ?", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: Um , no , it 's like X - sc it 's  it 's like I was thinking of type constraints but X - schema , well it obviously has to be an X - schema . \" Agent \" , I mean , the  the performer of the X - schema , that s depends on the X - schema . You know , and I  in general it would probably be , you know", "Grad E: So the difference is basically whether you thought it was obvious what the possible fillers were .", "Grad F: Yeah , basically .", "Grad A: Mm - hmm .", "Grad E: OK .", "Grad F: Um , \" aspectual type \" probably isn't obvious but I should have  So , I just neglected to stick something in . \" Perspective \" , \" actor \" , \" undergoer \" , \" observer \" , um ,", "Grad B: Mmm .", "Grad F: I think we 've often used \" agent \" , \" patient \" , obser", "Grad E: \" Whee ! \" That 's that one , right ?", "Grad F: Yeah , exactly .  Exactly . Um , and so one nice thing that , uh , we had talked about is this example  of like , if you have a passive construction then one thing it does is ch you know  definitely , it is one way to  for you to , you know , specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object . And so then we talked about , you know , whether well , does that specify topic as well ? Well , maybe there are other things . You know , now that it 's  subject is more like a topic . And now that , you know  Anyway . So . Sorry . I 'm gonna trail off on that one cuz it 's not that f important right now .", "Professor C: N now , for the moment we just need the ability to l l write it down if  if somebody figured out what the rules were .", "Grad F: Um , To know how  Yeah . Yeah . Exactly .", "Professor C: Yeah .", "Grad F: Um , some of these other ones , let 's see . So , uh , one thing I 'm uncertain about is how polarity interacts .", "Professor C: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: So polarity , uh , is using for like action did not take place for instance . So by default it 'll be like \" true \" , I guess , you know , if you 're specifying events that did happen . You could imagine that you skip out this  you know , leave off this polarity , you know , not  don't have it here . And then have it part of the speech - act in some way .", "Professor C: Mm - hmm .", "Grad F: There 's some negation . But the reason why I left it in is cuz you might have a change of state , let 's say , where some state holds and then some state doesn't hold , and you 're just talking , you know  if you 're trying to have the nuts and bolts of simulation you need to know that , you know , whatever , the holder doesn't and", "Professor C: No , I th I think at this lev which is  it should be where you have it .", "Grad F: OK , it 's  so it 's  it 's  it 's fine where it is .", "Professor C: I mean , how you get it may  may in will often involve the discourse", "Grad F: So , OK .

It 's a grab bag of", "Grad E: \" part of what I 'm going to hand you is a whole bunch of s uh , schemas , image , and X - schemas .

So we need a c", "Grad F: Uh , I mean , so it gets a little funny . These are all  so far these structures , especially from \" path \" and on down , these are sort of relatively familiar , um , image schematic kind of slots .

I thought that we would , uh  that the following thing would be in incredibly nice and I have no clue whether it will work at all or nothing .

You get the result , and you throw it away . And the  the nice thing about this idea is that you don't ever have to sit down and think about it or write about it . You may have some general rules as to how things can be  can be construed as what , so that will allow you to craft the  the  the initial notes .

Uh , then does that , eh  you know maybe with similar noise conditions and so forth ,  does it  does it then look much better ?", "PhD A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor D: And so what is the range over these different kinds of uh  of tests ?

And that was that , um , if you have  uh feed two streams into HTK , um , and you , uh , change the , uh variances  if you scale the variances associated with , uh these streams um , you can effectively scale  the streams . Right ? So , um , you know , without changing the scripts for HTK , which is the rule here , uh , you can still change the variances", "PhD A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor D: which would effectively change the scale of these  these , uh , two streams that come in .", "PhD A: Uh ,  yeah .", "Professor D: And , um , so , um , if you do that , for instance it may be the case that , um , the MLP should not be considered as strongly , for instance .", "PhD A: Mmm .", "Professor D: And , um , so this is just setting them to be , excuse me , of equal  equal weight . Maybe it shouldn't be equal weight .", "PhD B: Maybe .", "Professor D: Right ? You know , I I 'm sorry to say that gives more experiments if we wanted to look at that , but  but , uh , um , you know on the other hand it 's just experiments at the level of the HTK recognition .", "PhD A: Mmm .", "Professor D: It 's not even the HTK ,", "PhD A: Yeah .", "Professor D: uh , uh", "PhD B: Yeah . Yeah .", "Professor D: Well , I guess you have to do the HTK training also .", "PhD B: so this is what we decided to do .", "Professor D: Uh , do you ? Let me think . Maybe you don't . Uh . Yeah , you have to change the  No , you can just do it in  as  once you 've done the training", "Grad C: And then you can vary it . Yeah .", "Professor D: Yeah , the training is just coming up with the variances so I guess you could  you could just scale them all .", "PhD A: Scale", "Professor D: Variances .", "PhD A: Yeah . But  Is it  i th I mean the HTK models are diagonal covariances , so I d Is it", "Professor D: That 's uh , exactly the point , I think , that if you change  um , change what they are", "PhD A: Hmm . Mm - hmm .", "Professor D: It 's diagonal covariance matrices , but you say what those variances are .", "PhD A: Mm - hmm .", "Professor D: So , that  you know , it 's diagonal , but the diagonal means th that then you 're gonna  it 's gonna  it 's gonna internally multiply it  and  and uh ,  uh , i it im uh implicitly exponentiated to get probabilities , and so it 's  it 's gonna  it 's  it 's going to affect the range of things if you change the  change the variances  of some of the features .", "PhD A: Mmm . Mmm .", "PhD B: do ?", "Professor D: So , i it 's precisely given that model you can very simply affect , uh , the s the strength that you apply the features .

So it could just be that h treating them equally , tea treating two streams equally is just  just not the right thing to do .

Uh .", "PhD A: So , the next point , yeah , we 've had some discussion with Steve and Shawn , um , about their um , uh , articulatory stuff , um . So we 'll perhaps start something next week .", "Professor D: Mm - hmm .", "PhD A: Um , discussion with Hynek , Sunil and Pratibha for trying to plug in their our  our networks with their  within their block diagram , uh , where to plug in the  the network , uh , after the  the feature , before as um a as a plugin or as a anoth another path , discussion about multi - band and TRAPS , um , actually Hynek would like to see , perhaps if you remember the block diagram there is , uh , temporal LDA followed b by a spectral LDA for each uh critical band . And he would like to replace these by a network which would , uh , make the system look like a TRAP . Well , basically , it would be a TRAP system . Basically , this is a TRAP system  kind of TRAP system , I mean , but where the neural network are replaced by LDA . Hmm .  Um , yeah , and about multi - band , uh , I started multi - band MLP trainings , um mmh  Actually , I w I w hhh  prefer to do exactly what I did when I was in Belgium . So I take exactly the same configurations , seven bands with nine frames of context , and we just train on TIMIT , and on the large database , so , with SPINE and everything . And , mmm , I 'm starting to train also , networks with larger contexts . So , this would  would be something between TRAPS and multi - band because we still have quite large bands , and  but with a lot of context also . So Um Yeah , we still have to work on Finnish , um , basically , to make a decision on which MLP can be the best across the different languages . For the moment it 's the TIMIT network , and perhaps the network trained on everything . So . Now we can test these two networks on  with  with delta and large networks . Well , test them also on Finnish", "PhD B: Mmm .", "PhD A: and see which one is the  the  the best . Uh , well , the next part of the document is , well , basically , a kind of summary of what  everything that has been done . So . We have seventy - nine M L Ps trained on one , two , three , four , uh , three , four , five , six , seven ten  on ten different databases .", "Professor D: Mm - hmm .", "PhD A: Uh , the number of frames is bad also , so we have one million and a half for some , three million for other , and six million for the last one . Uh , yeah !  As we mentioned , TIMIT is the only that 's hand - labeled , and perhaps this is what makes the difference . Um . Yeah , the other are just Viterbi - aligned . So these seventy - nine MLP differ on different things . First , um with respect to the on - line normalization , there are  that use bad on - line normalization , and other good on - line normalization . Um . With respect to the features , with respect to the use of delta or no , uh with respect to the hidden layer size and to the targets .

Yeah , basically the observation is what we discussed already . The MSG problem , um , the fact that the MLP trained on target task decreased the error rate . but when the M - MLP is trained on the um  is not trained on the target task , it increased the error rate compared to using straight features .

But if you had , say , a heavily - reverberation ca heavy - reverberation case and a no - reverberation case , uh , and then you fed the thing , uh something that was a modest amount of reverberation then you 'd get some result in between the two .

So you  you think it 's perhaps better to have several M L Yeah but", "Professor D: It works better if  what ?", "PhD A: Yea", "Professor D: I see . Well , see , i oc You were doing some something that was  So maybe the analogy isn't quite right . You were doing something that was in way a little better behaved . You had reverb for a single variable which was re uh , uh , reverberation . Here the problem seems to be is that we don't have a hug a really huge net with a really huge amount of training data . But we have s f  for this kind of task , I would think ,  sort of a modest amount . I mean , a million frames actually isn't that much . We have a modest amount of  of uh training data from a couple different conditions , and then uh  in  yeah , that  and the real situation is that there 's enormous variability that we anticipate in the test set in terms of language , and noise type uh , and uh ,  uh , channel characteristic , sort of all over the map . A bunch of different dimensions . And so , I 'm just concerned that we don't really have  um , the data to train up  I mean one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in  we still don't have a good explanation for this , but we are seeing that we 're adding in uh , a fe few different databases and uh the performance is getting worse and uh , when we just take one of those databases that 's a pretty good one , it actually is  is  is  is  is better . And uh that says to me , yes , that , you know , there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that . But one way or another  we don't have uh , seemingly , the ability  to represent , in the neural net of the size that we have , um , all of the variability  that we 're gonna be covering . So that I 'm  I 'm  I 'm hoping that um , this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making , which is I 'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets , uh , that uh if we  if they look at more constrained conditions they  they 'll have enough parameters to really represent them .

Mm - hmm .", "Professor D: Yeah . I mean   i i e The um  I think it 's true that the OGI folk found that using LDA  RASTA , which is a kind of LogRASTA , it 's just that they have the  I mean it 's done in the log domain , as I recall , and it 's  it uh  it 's just that they d it 's trained up , right ? That that um benefitted from on - line normalization . So they did  At least in their case , it did seem to be somewhat complimentary . So will it be in our case , where we 're using the neural net ? I mean they  they were not  not using the neural net . Uh I don't know . OK , so the other things you have here are uh , trying to improve results from a single  Yeah . Make stuff better . OK . Uh .

We 've been sort of ignoring that , haven't we ?", "PhD A: Yeah , so I don't know .", "Professor D: But", "PhD A: But we have to address the problem of CPU and memory we", "Professor D: Yeah , but I li Well , I think  My impression  You  you folks have been looking at this more than me . But my impression was that  uh , there was a  a  a  a strict constraint on the delay ,", "PhD B: Yeah .", "Professor D: but beyond that it was kind of that uh using less memory was better , and  using less CPU was better . Something like that ,", "PhD A: Yeah , but", "Professor D: right ?", "PhD A: Yeah . So , yeah , but we 've  I don't know . We have to get some reference point to where we  Well , what 's a reasonable number ?

Yeah . Yeah , perhaps we could .", "Professor D: right ? So . Yeah . Well , OK . No , this is  I think this is good .

So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um  remote control . And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion . So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only . So no  we're not doing D_V_D_ , we're not doing anything else ,", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: it's just gonna be a television remote .  Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it .", "Project Manager: Um so that's red and black . And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . Um and no teletext . I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design .  For reasons that I don't really know . There's  but it's the board so there you go . So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh  um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote .  Anyway . So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on", "Industrial Designer: Okay . So do I unplug this bit here ?", "Project Manager: Oh , right yeah .", "Marketing: Gotta plug you in .", "Project Manager: Yep . Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up . Yep . Cool .", "Industrial Designer: Okay . Right . That's page one of my presentation .", "Project Manager: Brilliant .", "Marketing: Very nice . For your first PowerPoint it's lovely .", "Industrial Designer: So the uh method . We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . Um remote control works as follows . This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . Um sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad .", "Project Manager: 'Kay .", "Industrial Designer: Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . Um , components . Just some ideas that I had , um , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . Um the user interface , I was  since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect . Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's a word I made up , I don't really know what it means .", "Project Manager: 'Kay . Fair enough .", "Industrial Designer: Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range .", "Project Manager: 'Kay .", "Industrial Designer: Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . Um but in this case it'll only be TVs . Um personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , um , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits", "Marketing: Fine .", "Industrial Designer: which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value ,", "Project Manager: Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics", "Industrial Designer: 'cause we were thinking", "Project Manager: that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white  like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice ,", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Marketing: It needs , yeah .", "Project Manager: you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah that shouldn't be a problem . Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do .", "Project Manager: Okay , okay .", "Industrial Designer: That's the end of my presentation .", "Marketing: Cool .", "Project Manager: Great . Thank you very much Nathan .  Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well .", "Project Manager: S plug yourself in here .

Computer adjusting .", "User Interface: Th", "Project Manager: There you go . Sweet .", "Marketing: There you go .", "User Interface: Well so . Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . Um so a few of the requirements we need here . Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem .", "Project Manager: Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before .", "User Interface: Um so some of my findings . Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does . Um  now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well", "Project Manager: Oh yeah look at that .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "User Interface: but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it . As you also notice it's quite a boring design . Um . Another remote control , slightly different , it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions , um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring . So", "Project Manager: Nice .", "User Interface: my personal preferences .", "User Interface: Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control . Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with . And I was gonna add another uh slide here but I didn't quite have time there .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "User Interface: Um . Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh  .", "Project Manager: Great . Thanks for that Ron .", "Marketing: Right .", "Project Manager: 'Kay", "Marketing: Does that mean I'm up ?", "Project Manager: yep that's you .", "Marketing: I think so . Okay .", "User Interface: I can plug you in .", "Marketing: Oh that would be perfect . Thank you . Slide show up and running .", "Project Manager: Give it a little bit .", "Marketing: Or not . Uh . Oh there we go . Perfect . Okay . So this is me . Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort  like watching a hundred people  use TV remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general TV remote control practices . Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really really basic . Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , they're not using a lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with .  And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their  the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they can't find it in the room . So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people .  Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes ,", "Marketing: and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , that's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about . Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are the standards .  So it's a good start for us .", "Project Manager: That's great . Thank you Sarah . Right . So um", "Marketing: Need to unplug this ?", "Project Manager: yep I'll just uh switch that back here .", "Marketing: Need it back .", "Project Manager: I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase .", "Marketing: There you go .", "Project Manager: Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um  through you guys's presentations um  we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic .  Um Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control ,", "Marketing: Oh right .", "Project Manager: um so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is  um  we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics  um .", "Marketing: We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so .", "Project Manager: Yes . So maybe this  we should look into this younger demographic . Um . So", "Marketing: Right .", "Project Manager: uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics very well , we've got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um ,", "Marketing: Right .", "Project Manager: which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly .", "Marketing: Uh .", "Project Manager: Um so um .

Oh yeah .", "User Interface: Sure .", "Project Manager: True , if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um  yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important .

Um", "User Interface: Interface ?", "Project Manager: Yeah I think that would be best . Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost , try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea . With a touch screen for the basic functions .  Um  And we'll yeah tha let's provisionally  let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen .

Welcome to the seventh meeting of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. We will proceed to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements. That's confirmed. We will now proceed to presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. Once the petition is presented, the member is asked to bring it here to the Table. Mr.Manly is the first one to be allowed to present a petition.", "Mr. Paul Manly (NanaimoLadysmith, GP): Thank you, Mr. Chair. I rise today to present a petition that has many signatures from constituents in NanaimoLadysmith. They're calling for a ban on cosmetic testing using animals. They want us to follow the European Union model, under which the use of animals in cosmetic testing has been banned. Moving forward, they're calling for a ban on the sale and manufacture of animal-tested cosmetics and their ingredients in Canada.", "The Chair: Mr. Poilievre is next.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre (Carleton, CPC): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I rise today to table e-petition 2466, initiated by a constituent of mine in Stittsville, a beautiful west Ottawa community. The petition has collected 827 signatures from every province and territory. It was collected by Cara, a mother from my riding who suffered an unthinkable tragedy. Her 11-year-old son Joshua drowned in a boating accident on the St. Lawrence River at Rockport, Ontario. Joshua was not wearing a life jacket. Worse, Cara's family had to wait 48 days to recover Joshua's body. Cara is now working tirelessly to amend the small vessel regulations to make it mandatory for children under the age of 14 to wear a life jacket or PFD while they are passengers in or drivers of small vessels covered under parts 2, 3, and 4 of the regulations. I support Cara's efforts, and I'm honoured to table this petition on her behalf.", "The Chair: Seeing no further petitions to be presented, we'll continue, and we will now proceed to the questioning of ministers. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to replace each other safely. Go ahead, Mr. Scheer.", "Hon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition): It was revealed yesterday that this government's policy was to ignore fraud. The Prime Minister's reaction was to act as if everything was normal. In fact, we've learned that over 200,000cases of suspected fraud have been identified in the benefit applications. The Prime Minister is failing our future generations. Our children and grandchildren are going to pay back billions of dollars that he's borrowing to pay tax cheats. Will the Prime Minister protect taxpayers and immediately begin a review of these 200,000cases of suspected fraud?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister): Our priority was to get money out quickly to all Canadians who needed it, and that's exactly what we've done. Millions of Canadians have received the money they so desperately needed. Having said that, I want to make it very clear, Mr.Chair: Fraud is unacceptable. We have measures in place to detect fraud. All fraudsters will be required to pay back the money they fraudulently received from the government. We're going to make sure that this is done in the coming months.", "Hon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, Conservatives agree that those who need help should get it, and no one is arguing that they shouldn't, but reports indicate that the Liberals have ordered public servants to turn a blind eye to 200,000 cases of suspected fraud. It's a simple question: Yes or no, did the government instruct any government department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, the priority in this situation was getting money out to the millions of Canadians who needed it as quickly as possible, but of course fraud is unacceptable. That's why we have put safeguards in place to ensure that anyone who received that money fraudulently will have to repay it.", "Hon. Andrew Scheer: It's a yes-or-no question, Mr. Chair. Did the government give any kind of instruction to public servants in any department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases, yes or no?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: The instruction to government officials was to get money out to those who needed it as quickly as possible. We have put measures in place to detect fraud. People who got this money fraudulently will have to repay.", "Hon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, it is clear that he can't answer a yes-or-no question, so we can all assume what the answer must be. In other situations, the government is saying no to people. It's letting so many Canadians down. Small business owners who don't happen to have a CRA payroll number or a business account are ineligible for the government supports. Individuals, owner-operators, and those who are earning $1 more than $1,000 are being told that they don't qualify for the emergency response benefits. Meanwhile, fraudsters are getting them. Does the Prime Minister think it's fair to tell people who are following all the rules no, while telling government officials to allow fraudulent cases to be processed?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, Canadians well know that this is an unprecedented situation, one in which we had to get help to as many Canadians as possible as quickly as possible. That is exactly what we did. We continue to work very hard to fill gaps for people who should get money but haven't been able to, and, as I said, we have strong measures to counter fraud. Anyone who got this money fraudulently will have to repay it.", "Hon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, when these programs were first designed, the Prime Minister said that he acknowledged that there were problems and that they would be fixed later. Well, here we are in May, and hundreds of thousands of Canadians are being told no for purely technical and bureaucratic reasons. Will the Prime Minister make the simple changes to allow business owners who don't happen to have a business bank account, who don't happen to have a CRA payroll number and individuals who are ineligible for the emergency response benefit because they've been paid by family members through dividends to qualify, or is he going to continue to let hundreds of thousands of Canadians down during this pandemic?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, from the beginning of this pandemic, we moved extremely rapidly to get help and support to millions of Canadians. That was the priority, and that's what we've been doing for the past two months. As we've said, we will continue to tweak and improve the programs to make sure that more people who need help will get it. We are working the best we can, as fast as we can, to help those millions of Canadians who need support.", "The Chair: You have time for about a 15-second question, Mr. Scheer.", "Hon. Andrew Scheer: Mr. Chair, the Prime Minister indicated that he would support Taiwan's inclusion in the WHO only as a non-state observer. Of course, that designation does not exist. Participants of the WHO are either states or NGOs. Will the Prime Minister support Taiwan's participation as a state observer?", "The Chair: The Right Honourable Prime Minister has 15 seconds or less, please.", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, we will continue with our one China policy, but we have always advocated Taiwan's meaningful inclusion in international bodies where it makes sense to do so, and that includes at the WHO.", "The Chair: Mr.Blanchet now has the floor.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet (BeloeilChambly, BQ): Thank you very much, Mr.Chair. On Friday, students in Quebec and Canada will be able to apply for the Canada emergency student benefit, which is a good thing. This program was necessary, particularly because the number of students who won't be able to get back their jobs from last year is much higher than the number of jobs that might be available to these young people. There are also issues of duration. We don't know how long these jobs will remain unavailable. People talked about a risk to being in the labour market and meeting the needs of the labour market. On April29, the Deputy Prime Minister made a formal commitment to ensure that these programs are accompanied by work incentives for youth and all CESB recipients. So that everyone knows what they're getting into, I'd like to know whether the employment incentives that will accompany the Canada emergency response benefit will be known by Friday.", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: I thank the hon. member for understanding the importance of supporting students who, for the most part, won't be able to get the summer jobs they were counting on. Young people don't just want to earn money; they also want to gain work experience. That's why we're setting up programs, including Canada summer jobs, but also another program with 76,000new jobs for young people in important sectors, so that young people can also get jobs. We will continue to work with youth and employers to ensure that gaps in the labour market are addressed, while ensuring that youth are well-supported.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: That's very interesting, but it doesn't answer my question at all. People in the fishing, tourism and agricultural sectors, as well as municipalities and, from the very beginning, of course, the Government of Quebec, more generally, have expressed fears that job gains will cause people to lose their benefits and discourage them from going to work. The only way to avoid that is to ensure that people keep more money as they work more. That is the principle. In fact, we propose that over the $1,000no-penalty limit, half of the earnings be exempt from penalty. Is this something that could be considered? Since it's been two weeks since the commitment was made and it's urgent, can we act now? The emergency shouldn't last eight months.", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, young people need money, but they also need work experience. This is an unprecedented situation, which is why we're working with seasonal industries and the different regions to make sure they have a sufficient workforce in their situation. Students can be part of it, but at the same time we must provide the necessary support for those who can't find a job. That's why we continue to work with the industries involved to ensure that they have a sufficient workforce while we support students.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Unfortunately, the spirit of it doesn't seem to have been understood. I doubt that, even in the best-case scenario, the government will be able to get all the jobs needed in a timely manner for all these young people to decide to go ahead. So, first of all, there will be a shortage of jobs. Second, people aren't crazy. If they earn less by working than they earn by not working, all the good faith in the world won't solve the problem. Can we make sure that people keep more money in their pockets as they work more? I think we can have a clear answer, given the timeframe. People are going to start registering for the program on Friday. The principles are good, but a clear answer would be good too.", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Beginning Friday, students will be able to apply for the Canada emergency student benefit. When they apply, they'll all be directed to a job bank that we've set up to make sure they know what jobs are available to get not only the money they need, but also the experience they need for their future, while helping our society in this crisis. I know we're going to be able to count on young people.", "The Chair: We'll now go to Mr. Singh.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh (Burnaby South, NDP): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, one of the most devastating outcomes of this COVID-19 crisis has been the impact on seniors. Eighty per cent or more of the deaths during COVID-19 have been seniors living in long-term care homes. The military had to be called in. Out of 14 countries, Canada has been deemed the worst in its care of seniors. Despite all this, the Prime Minister has said recently that he doesn't feel it's the federal government's responsibility to find a solution. How can he say to families reeling with loss that it's not the federal government's responsibility to play a role in solving this problem?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, perhaps the fact that the NDP no longer has many seats in Quebec has caused it to forget the importance of respecting the Constitution and the areas of jurisdiction of provincial versus federal governments. We will be there to work with the provinces as they deal with challenges in their long-term care facilities. We are there as a partner, but we, on this side of the House, will always respect the jurisdiction of the provinces and be there to support them in fulfilling those responsibilities.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Everyone across Canada has just heard this Prime Minister double down on the idea that he doesn't feel it's his responsibility, despite the fact that the Canadian military had to go into long-term care homes. There is a role that the federal government can play. Both Liberal and Conservative federal governments have been consistently, for decades, cutting transfers to health care. They can increase those transfers to ensure long-term care is adequately funded. We could also ensure that there's a national care guarantee, working with provinces to ensure that we are meeting the best standards. We could increase workers' pay. We could ensure that there's no more profiting off the backs of seniors when it comes to long-term care. Will the Prime Minister commit to some of these care guarantees?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: It will come as exactly no surprise to the vast majority of Canadians that the Liberal Party will always stand up for the Constitution of Canada. We respect the Constitution. We respect areas of provincial jurisdiction. As I have said from the very beginning of this crisis, we will be there to help the provinces as they manage the challenges they're facing. The federal government does have a role to play, and it is a role to support the provinces in doing the things they need to do during this unprecedented time. We will continue to be there.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: I am glad to hear the Prime Minister is no longer trying to hide behind jurisdiction. We know that in long-term care homes, the for-profit long-term care homes have been the site of the worst conditions, where the greatest number of seniors have died. Will the Prime Minister join us in committing to remove profit from the long-term care system? Vulnerable seniors should not be subject to the profits of a company willing to cut services, staffing and quality of care instead of ensuring that seniors get the best care possible.", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: I think it has become clear for all Canadians that we need to improve the care offered to our seniors right across the country. We cannot look at these numbers we are seeing and these tragedies hitting so many families and not want to see us as a country do better. That is why we of course recognize that we will work with other orders of government, particularly the provinces in whose jurisdiction this area rests primarily, to support answering these questions for the long term on how we improve the way Canada supports our elders. This is something really important that we will be there for.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: At the CHSLD Herron in Dorval, 31seniors died in one month. The residents were left without food, dehydrated and without care, and those with COVID-19 symptoms were not isolated from the others. Families pay between $3,000 and $10,000 a month for their loved ones to be at the centre. How can the Prime Minister think that he doesn't have a role to play in finding a solution to this devastating problem?", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr.Chair, all Quebeckers and even all Canadians were stunned to learn of the tragedy at the Dorval CHSLD. We were very happy, as citizens, when the Government of Quebec reacted firmly and asked many questions in connection with this situation. We will support the Government of Quebec in its efforts to find answers and, most importantly, to ensure that, in the long term, the country will better support seniors in all regions.", "The Chair: We'll continue with Mr.Poilievre.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: Mr. Chair, how many emergency response benefit cheques have been sent to people whose applications have been flagged as fraudulent?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos (President of the Treasury Board): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I'd like to start by quickly saying that a total of 7.7million Canadians have received the Canada emergency response benefit, which is absolutely essential for", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: How many emergency response benefits have been sent out to people whose applications have been flagged as fraudulent?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr.Chair, I see that the pace will allow me to give a little bit of information for each question. As we said at the outset, there will be mechanisms", "The Chair: Mr.Poilievre has the floor.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: How many?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: We're working very hard.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: How many?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: We're working very hard to ensure the integrity of the mechanism while at the same time taking important steps to help Canadians.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: How many emergency response benefit cheques have been sent to people whose applications have been flagged as fraudulent?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: A total of 7.7million Canadians have received the Canada emergency response benefit, and the agency is ensuring the integrity of the system.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: He's now claiming that it's all 7.7 million? That's crazy. The department is reported to have given out 200,000. Is 200,000 the correct number of cheques that have been sent out to people whose applications have been red-flagged as fraudulent, yes or no?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr.Chair, I'm pleased to use the opportunity given to me by the hon. member to make the following clarifications. I thank him for it. First, approximately 7.7million Canadians have received at least one payment. Second, almost 11million payments have been made.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: How many prisoners have received a Canada emergency response benefit cheque?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: This allows me to go even further and thank the hon. member again. Some 7.7million Canadians have received emergency assistance in an emergency situation", "The Chair: Mr.Poilievre has the floor.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: So now he's claiming that 7 million Canadians are in jail? The question was this: How many prisoners have received a benefit cheque?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr.Chair, jokes can be made about the plight of Canadians who are suffering tremendously in this crisis, but I'm not here to make", "The Chair: Mr.Poilievre has the floor.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: Even the CBC is saying that prisoners are receiving the cheque. They can't have lost their jobs. They were already in prison. It's a simple question: How many prisoners have received the cheques?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: I'd like to remind hon. members that we're talking about an extremely serious situation, a situation that has called into question people's ability to make ends meet, a situation that required emergency measures. We're going to continue to do the job that Canadians expect.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: The question was, how many prisoners have received the cheques?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: I've already explained to the hon. memberand I'm pleased to remind himthat this benefit is an emergency measure.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: The Auditor General says that he's dropping half of his audits because the government refuses to provide him with funding. If the government has enough money to send 200,000 fraudulent applicants emergency cheques, why won't the government give the Auditor General the funding he requested?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: I thank the hon. member. It gives me the opportunity, in this emergency situation, to talk about the role of institutions, including that of the Auditor General, which we will continue to support because it helps us do things right.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: Then what does the Auditor General have to do to get the money to do his audits? Does he have to file a bunch of fraudulent applications for an emergency response benefit?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr.Chair, because I know the hon. member well enough, I'm sure that he isn't givingand doesn't want to givethe impression that the Auditor General wants to commit fraud to do his job properly.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: I agree, and that's why he should get the money he needs to do his job. He did twice as many audits under the previous government as he is doing now, but he doesn't have the money to do the audits he needs to do to keep an eye on this government's extraordinary spending. Yes or no, will the government give the Auditor General the funding he has requested so he can get back to doing the same number of audits he did under the much more robust funding of the previous Harper government?", "The Chair: The hon. Prime Minister.", "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: Mr. Chair, the previous government cut funding to the Auditor General and caused the office to lay off dozens of employees. We increased the funding for the Auditor General. We recognize the important work the Auditor General needs to do, and that's why we increased the funding for the Auditor General. The party of the member opposite cut this funding.", "The Chair: I appreciate the help from some of the members in keeping time. I do have my own chronograph here, so I'll take care of it from this end, but I appreciate the help. Thank you. I now give the floor to Mr.Deltell.", "Mr. Grard Deltell (Louis-Saint-Laurent, CPC): Mr.Chair, I fully agree with the Treasury Board President that we aren't here to make jokes, but to set the record straight for Canadians. Yesterday, the National Post reported on the front page that 200,000people had fraudulently used emergency assistance. Is that statement accurate, yes or no?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr.Chair, I thank the hon. member from my region. A few minutes ago, I was reminding people in my region that, in the greater Quebec City area, about 200,000people had received this emergency benefit and that it was not for fraudulent reasons, but because they really needed it.", "Mr. Grard Deltell: The question is about fraudsters, and I know that there aren't many of them in Quebec City. That said, my question is very simple. I want to know whether or not 200,000people fraudulently used emergency assistance.", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: I know my colleague already knows this, but we announced at the outset that strong and rigorous mechanisms would be put in place quickly to ensure that this delivery would respect the importance of integrity in government.", "Mr. Grard Deltell: The integrity of the government must be upheld, and this must be done by telling the truth. Yesterday, the National Post reported on the front page about 200,000fraudsters. Is that correct, yes or no?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: To set the record straight, the Minister of National Revenue, Ms.Lebouthillier, made it very clear that there was no tolerance for fraud in this system, that all mechanisms would be put in place to ensure that integrity would be respected.", "Mr. Grard Deltell: The Treasury Board President is one of the few Canadians to find that Ms.Lebouthillier was very clear yesterday. With respect to the Minister of National Revenue, I would point out that the member for RichmondArthabaska asked her a very clear question yesterday, which she was unable to answer. What does a person who has received the full CERB, $2,000, and returns to work this week have to do? Do they have to pay back the amount they aren't entitled to? Do they keep the$2,000? Do they have to wait and include it on their next year's tax return? Which of these three options should the person choose?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: I thank the hon. member for his question, which is very relevant. In fact, that person must contact Service Canada or the Canada Revenue Agency, depending on the system under which he or she received this benefit, and ensure that, in the circumstances that apply to him or her, the decisions and actions taken are appropriate.", "Mr. Grard Deltell: It's too bad, Mr.Chair, because it's the boss who is in front of me, here in committee. It's good that the citizen calls the public servant, but the public servant's boss is the Treasury Board President. Can he give a clear indication to citizens? What should they do now with the emergency assistance they received with this month's benefit? Should they keep it in full or pay it back now? I'd like a clear answer, please.", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Again, I recognize the importance of insisting on clarity. What's clear here is that each person must make decisions based on his or her own circumstances, and the responsible way to act is to interact with public servants at Service Canada or the Canada Revenue Agency.", "Mr. Grard Deltell: Service Canada employees must have clear instructions from their boss. The boss is here. This is the President of the Treasury Board. Could the President of the Treasury Board, in very clear terms, tell the employees answering questions from Canadians what they have to say to those currently receiving the Canada emergency response benefit, but who are actually at work? These are honest people. They are not fraudsters. They want to comply with the law. Can the President of the Treasury Board give them clear instructions?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: That is extraordinary, because my colleague focused on two key terms: honesty and hard work. In terms of the honesty of Canadians, in all cases, I am convinced that they will contact the appropriate officials. As for the hard work of those officials, they know what they have to do and they have been doing it in an exemplary way since the crisis began.", "Mr. Grard Deltell: And yet those good officials, whom I frequently commend on social media for their excellent work, have no clear instructions from their boss. Mr.President, let me go back to the basic question. The National Post said that 200,000Canadians have used the emergency assistance fraudulently, to the tune of $1.6billion. Is that the case, yes or no?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: I am sure that the honourable member is not questioning the ability of Canada Revenue Agency officers to follow the very clear directive of ensuring that the mechanisms reflect the importance of maintaining the integrity of the Government of Canada during the exceptional circumstances we are experiencing.", "The Chair: We'll now go on to Ms. Gray.", "Mrs. Tracy Gray (KelownaLake Country, CPC): Mr. Chair, last week British Columbia unveiled its plan to begin reopening its economy. I've been speaking with many business owners and business associations in my riding, and I'm hearing that they're not getting their orders for cleaning supplies. Some businesses have said their back orders go back to March. They do not know how they can possibly reopen if they are not meeting health cleaning standards or accessing PPE for their employees and customers. They are well aware of the issues arising from this government's reliance on Chinese manufacturing rather than building capacity here. What is the government doing to address these issues and ensure wholesale supply companies get products now so that they can distribute them to the businesses that need them?", "Hon. Anita Anand (Oakville, Lib.): Mr. Chair, our government is rapidly and aggressively buying life-saving equipment that Canada needs from a diverse range of suppliers. We are building up domestic capacity as well as procuring internationally. Our priority is to make sure front-line health care workers have the support they need. In terms of other areas of the economy, we are working with our federal and provincial counterparts to make sure that we can do so in collaboration with them.", "Mrs. Tracy Gray: Mr. Chair, an ongoing concern I've heard from small business owners is that they are ineligible for CEBA because they don't have a business account. When I brought up this point to small business minister Ng at committee, she said it was the first time that she had heard of this issue and that she would follow up. I asked this question on April 23, and it's now been almost three weeks. Small business has been let down. Can the government confirm that they're going to fix this issue?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains (MississaugaMalton, Lib.): Chair, I'd like to thank the honourable member for her question. It is really important that this program that we've established help small businesses. We have shown in the past that we're very flexible and nimble in accommodating the needs of businesses. I assure the member opposite that we are looking into this matter and will come forward with a resolution in a timely manner.", "Mrs. Tracy Gray: Mr. Chair, I just read another email from a small business owner this morning who has been let down by the government. He chose to pay off debts instead of paying himself a wage; therefore, he's ineligible for CEBA, for that loan. Owner-operators have been eliminated from participating in government programs because they did not put themselves on the payroll. This shows a true lack of understanding of small businesses and especially of owner-operators. Will the government commit to fixing this issue?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Thank you very much. Again, I want to thank the honourable member for her question. We have focused particularly on small businesses to make sure they have the appropriate support they need. With regard to the program that she highlighted, we have shown flexibility in the eligibility criteria by decreasing the payroll threshold for individual companies that want to apply for this loan to $20,000 versus $50,000, and the upper limit has gone to $1.5 million versus $1 million. We will continue to bring forward the changes necessary to have more businesses", "Mrs. Tracy Gray: This government has left Canadian craft breweries out to dry, like the hops in their beer. On April 24, the Canadian Craft Brewers Association released a report on the effects of COVID-19 on the Canadian craft brewing industry. The report states that 38% of craft brewers did not qualify for the Canadian emergency wage subsidy in March, and 53% were either not sure or predicted that they would not qualify in April. Many a brew pub, like BNA in my riding, due to higher payrolls are also not eligible for the CEBA loan. They have been left out and let down. Five per cent of these breweries have already closed permanently, and others are on the verge of doing so. A portion have stepped up and are making PPE. Will this government take the initiative to support this industry by amending program requirements?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: When it comes to the Canada emergency wage subsidy, we have demonstrated flexibility and nimbleness. The program requirement changed in terms of revenue threshold. We originally had 30% for the month of March. We changed that to 15%. The eligibility criteria to compare to the first two months of this year now also compare to the previous year as well. We're going to continue to make changes to make sure more businesses can access this program.", "The Chair: Ms. Gray, you have 33 seconds.", "Mrs. Tracy Gray: In my constituency, Okanagan fruit production is a huge industry, and many apple orchardists have brought concerns to me regarding high costs, apples from last season selling below cost, the CUSMA agreement not helping the industy, and low-priced Washington apples flooding our market. COVID-19 has exacerbated their dire financial situation. The BC Fruit Growers' Association has called the government announcements of measures for agriculture underwhelming. I questioned Minister Bibeau in the House a couple of months ago, and at the time she did not have an answer. What is the plan to help our orchardists?", "The Chair: The honourable minister.", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau (ComptonStanstead, Lib.): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Since this crisis began, we have been helping entrepreneurs in all sectors. We began with measures to assist small, medium and large companies, and we are now going progressively sector by sector. Last week, we announced additional funding for agriculture", "The Chair: We'll now go on to Mr. Barlow.", "Mr. John Barlow (Foothills, CPC): Mr. Chair, in my riding of Foothills, we've established a Foothills business recovery task force. We surveyed hundreds of small business owners about the effectiveness of the emergency programs put forward by the government. The results of that survey were quite alarming. More than half of the respondents have not qualified for any of the programs, and the vast majority of them have said their businesses will not last more than another month. Will the government expand the eligibility for some of these programs to include sole proprietorships, or is the government still looking at refunding the GST paid by some of the businesses over the last year?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, I want to highlight the fact that we have issued 590,000 loans through the CEBA account. This demonstrates that this particular program is working and that businesses are taking advantage of it. We recognize that we want to be more generous and more thoughtful about these programs. We've demonstrated flexibility in the past and we will continue to be nimble going forward.", "Mr. John Barlow: Mr. Chair, to the Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Charlebois said that we are on the precipice of losing 15% of our farms and that 30,000 farm families are at risk of bankruptcy. This will have a devastating effect on our rural economies. Does the minister know the impact that losing 30,000 family farms will have on our food security and the price of groceries on the store shelves?", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Mr.Chair, the agriculture and agri-food sector is extremely important. We have clearly stated that it is an essential service. That is why we have risk management programs that are already well established. I understand that producers would like the programs to be more generous, and we are ready to do more, but they first need to use those programs. They have $1.6billion available", "Mr. John Barlow: Mr. Chair, business risk management programs don't apply to every single stakeholder and the programs are not working for the producers. There is a bottleneck right now in our processing capacity. When the minister renounced the AgriRecovery program, funds were set aside for cattle and pork producers. When is that money going to be available, and how long will it last?", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: We are talking about two different programs here. We added $77.5million to the program helping the processing sector and $50million on two occasions for our pork and beef producers under the AgriRecovery program. Once again, that is additional money. In recent years, an average of $15million have gone out of this program, whereas this year", "The Chair: Mr. Barlow.", "Mr. John Barlow: Mr. Chair, it is not new money; it has been budgeted year after year and it's budgeted again for next year. The cattlemen said that the set-aside funds that the minister is talking about are already gone and did not last even two weeks. If this government isn't assisting Canadian farmers, is the government's food policy to rely on food imported from foreign countries to feed Canadian families ?", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Mr.Chair, the fund to assist our beef producers cannot have already disappeared because the criteria will be unveiled in the coming days. I can assure you that we are working as efficiently as possible so that the program can be rolled out and the money can be channelled to our beef and pork producers.", "Mr. John Barlow: Mr. Chair, producers across this country have said that an exemption from the carbon tax would help them greatly during this pandemic. When I asked the minister about any data that was available for the impact the carbon tax had on agriculture, the answer I got was that this information was secret. Yesterday at committee, the minister said that this was a mistake and that this information has been public. My staff and I looked everywhere last night, as did journalists, and that information could not be found. Is that information actually available?", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Yes, Mr.Chair, that information is available and public. I will happily pass the information on to my colleague.", "Mr. John Barlow: If that data is available, then the minister must know the financial impacts that the carbon tax has on Canadian farmers. With the information that the minister apparently has, does she agree with the Prime Minister that Canadian farmers are much better off financially by paying the carbon tax?", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Each organization analyzes different assumptions, methodologies and geographic areas, so the results give a broad range of estimated impacts. According to the organization that has provided information, in 2019, the estimated impacts of a $20-per-tonne price on pollution due to grain drying ranged", "The Chair: We'll go back to Mr. Barlow. You have 30 seconds, please.", "Mr. John Barlow: Does the minister agree with the Prime Minister that farmers are financially better off paying the carbon tax?", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Mr.Chair, the price on pollution is an extremely important measure for our economy in general and for our transition to a greener economy. We have already provided various exemptions to the agriculture sector: for gasoline, for the access card and for the greenhouse sector.", "The Chair: The next question goes to Mr. Kelly.", "Mr. Pat Kelly (Calgary Rocky Ridge, CPC): Will the government fully fund the Office of the Auditor General?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Thank you, Mr. Chair. The answer is that we have done that in 2018 and 2019, and the Prime Minister", "Mr. Pat Kelly: Mr. Chair, I hope the minister would not want to mislead the House. The office is certainly not fully funded, as per the testimony we heard yesterday at the finance committee. This government has expanded the Auditor General's responsibilities without adequate resources. When will the government fully fund the Auditor General?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: To continue my answer, and as the Prime Minister said just a moment ago, that has led to the hiring of 38 new staff members. That's great to hear, because they are doing even better than they used to before we came into power.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: No previous auditor general in Canadian history has ever had to tell a parliamentary committee that they had insufficient funds to do their job. That is what in fact this Auditor General has done. When will the government fully fund the Office of the Auditor General?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: I'm glad again to be given the ability to say how important the work of the Auditor General is. We believe very much in that role. That's why we increased the funding that is necessary for that office to do its important job. We will keep working hard with the Auditor General.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: Sadly, Michael Ferguson passed away in 2019, yet the government has refused to name a permanent replacement. Why?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr. Chair, this is another wonderful opportunity to remind all members of this House of the importance of these institutions. When we face these tragic deaths, we of course are very sad of the passing of the people, and we work", "The Chair: Go ahead, Mr. Kelly.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: Yesterday the Parliamentary Budget Officer said that Canada's debt could reach $1 trillion this year. What will it cost to service a $1-trillion debt?", "Hon. Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance): Mr. Speaker, we remain committed to doing, as we've said, whatever it takes to support Canadians through this challenging time. We think this is extremely important, and we will continue to focus on the well-being of all Canadians.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: What is the estimated annual debt servicing cost of the aid measures announced so far?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, there will be an opportunity for us to give a full outline of the costs and benefits of our measures, and we will do that when we have the ability to have", "The Chair: Mr. Kelly.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: is Canada's AAA credit rating.", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Speaker, Canada came into this crisis with a very strong fiscal position, and of course we will experience challenges as we move forward, but we believe that we should experience those challenges as we support Canadians.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: What would the effect of a downgrade be on Canada's debt servicing costs?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we will continue to focus on how we can support Canadians and Canadian businesses as we get through this challenge.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: How many private sector bank loans have been funded for small and medium-sized businesses under the business credit availability program?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, as the information on the business credit availability program becomes available, we are being fully transparent with the finance committee and with this House.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: Does the minister know how many loans have been funded under that program?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I'm not in the habit of memorizing every single number available to us, but what I can confirm is that we will be transparent with this House on the numbers as they become available.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: Does the minister know the dollar amount or the approximate dollar amount so far lent and guaranteed by Export Development Canada?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, one number that would probably be helpful for people to understand is that we've now had over 550,000 approved loans under the CEBA program, representing over 20 billion dollars' worth of money that's actually", "The Chair: Mr. Kelly.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: Will the government fix the CEBA program to include businesses that pay owner-operators through dividends?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I think the language fix is incorrect, for more than 500,000 businesses have received this loan. Of course, we are always endeavouring to make sure it works for as many businesses as possible.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: Will the government fix CEBA to cover small businesses that hire day labourers or subcontractors?", "The Chair: The honourable minister.", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, again we've demonstrated flexibility and nimbleness when it comes to this program. We changed the eligibility criteria to make sure that more businesses can apply and be eligible for this program. We will endeavour to make sure that more Canadians have access to this program, particularly small businesses in rural and remote communities.", "Mr. Pat Kelly: Will the government fix CEBA to cover business owners who use personal instead of business chequing accounts to operate their business?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Again, Mr. Chair, I want to highlight the fact that this has been a very positive program and well received by many small businesses. Over 590,000 small business loans have been issued, and that's a testament to the design of the program. We're going to make sure we continue to engage with small businesses.", "The Chair: The next question goes to Mr. Chong.", "Hon. Michael Chong (WellingtonHalton Hills, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Last week, on Friday, Statistics Canada was to release labour force survey data at 8:30 a.m. eastern time, one of the most important and market-moving indicators of the month, but someone in the government leaked that information ahead of time, almost 45 minutes ahead of time, and exclusively to Bloomberg terminal users on Wall Street and on Bay Street, who pay thousands of dollars a month for those terminals. Moving markets, the Canadian dollar moved eight basis points in that short period of time and billions were made or lost on the market. Section 34 of the Statistics Act makes it a criminal offence for someone to leak information that might influence stock, bond or currency markets. Has the government notified the RCMP about what appears to be a criminal breach of the Statistics Act?", "The Chair: The honourable minister.", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, I'd like to thank the honourable member for his question. I, too, share the same concerns that he's highlighted with regard to this leak. This is completely unacceptable. That is why we're going to make sure that a proper and thorough examination is done, and going forward we want to make sure that no such breach or leak occurs.", "Hon. Michael Chong: Mr. Chair, Statistics Canada said that staffers and ministers' offices, including the Prime Minister's office, the finance minister's office, the employment minister's office and the industry minister's office, would have received this secret information no earlier than 2 p.m. the previous day. Statistics Canada has also indicated that it has begun an internal investigation. Will the minister commit to fully co-operating with this investigation?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: I'd like to remind the honourable colleague that our government has supported Statistics Canada. We're the ones who reintroduced the mandatory long-form census. We're the ones who funded more money for Statistics Canada. The member opposite knows that we'll be fully co-operative in any such investigation into any leak.", "Hon. Michael Chong: Will the minister commit to making the results of this investigation public?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, the member opposite knows full well that there are proper processes and protocols in place when it comes to such sensitive matters, and we will ensure that those processes and protocols", "The Chair: Mr. Chong.", "Hon. Michael Chong: Mr. Chair, I hope there is no double standard for ministers' offices and the public service, because it was only about 13 years ago that a public servant was criminally charged and convicted for using top secret information in the markets. I hope that in this investigation, and in the release of the information concerning this investigation, ministers' staffers aren't held to a different standard than the public service has been held to. This leak speaks to the integrity of the government. Intelligence at the Five Eyes.... Our four allies have been telling us for years that one of the top two or three threats that democracies are facing is declining public confidence in our key institutions. Democracies have been blindsided by misinformation, disinformation and cyber-attacks, and now we are being blindsided by the misuse of information by this very government. That doesn't even.... The government's own national statistics-gathering agency doesn't trust this cabinet or this government, and that's why they announced several days ago that they would suspend the pre-release of information to the cabinet. What is the government going to do to restore public confidence in our institutions?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, our government has remained steadfast in its support for Statistics Canada. I'd like to remind my honourable colleague that we are the government that brought forward legislation to strengthen the independence of Statistics Canada. We're the government that brought forward measures to make sure they have additional monies for conducting the proper mandatory long-form census as well. When it comes to the leak that the member opposite is talking about, we're not going to prejudge the outcome. We have been very clear that the proper processes and protocols that are in place will be followed.", "The Chair: You have time for a very brief question, Mr. Chong.", "Hon. Michael Chong: Mr. Chair, I hope the government will call the RCMP and notify them about what appears to be a criminal breach of the Statistics Act, because it was a previous Liberal minister who himself was subject to a lot of misinformation and was a target of improper allegations about his office's use of information that leaked about the income trust changes that the previous Liberal government had brought in. The RCMP began an investigation and, in the course of the investigation, they charged a public servant who was ultimately convicted of breaching that secret information. I hope the minister holds his office and the offices of his cabinet colleagues to the same standard, calls in the RCMP and makes them aware of what appears to be a criminal breach of the Statistics Act.", "The Chair: The honourable minister, in 30 seconds or less, please.", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: I'm sorry. How much time do I have, Mr. Chair?", "The Chair: We're over the time, but I'm allowing 30 seconds so we can get a full", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: I appreciate that very much. Again, I want to take this opportunity to say that leaks of this nature are completely unacceptable. We've been very clear that we are going to take the appropriate steps. Statistics Canada is taking the appropriate steps. I want to remind the member opposite that we're not going to prejudge any outcome at this stage. Again, it is our government that has been consistently supporting Statistics Canada in its work through the previous years.", "The Chair: Thank you. We'll take a short break to allow our console operators to switch in a healthy way. While we're doing that, I'm going to mention something. It happens at the end of a question. When there's less than a minute left and the question goes over half the time left over, I'll just indicate to the person asking the question that we've reached the limit so that the other side can answer with the same amount of time and we have a fair playing field. We're ready to go again. The Honourable Member for BeloeilChambly has the floor.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Thank you, Mr.Chair. We are making progress, but unfortunately, I'd like to hear it in French as well. I will address my question to the Prime Minister. First, let me remind you that, on March12, the government announced a first series of measures of about $1billion to adapt to what was at the time the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, including $500million in transfers to the provinces, with about $100million going to Quebec. Since that time, the commitments from the government have reached very probably around $300billion, making those first $500 million pale by comparison. Of course, the crisis became longer and it is not over yet. In that context, and given what I heard the Prime Minister say a little earlier about respecting the areas of jurisdiction of the provinces, and of Quebec, can we expect a speedy increase in health transfers to Quebec and the provinces, an increase that would be permanent, and, of course, without conditions?", "The Chair: The honourable minister has the floor.", "Hon. Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health): Thank you, Mr.Chair. We've increased health transfers to provinces and territories significantly since we first came into government in 2015. We continue to work with provinces and territories on a regular basis to make sure they're supported not just in the outbreak of this pandemic, but in the increased cost overall to health care across the country. Our investments have included investments for mental health, for home care and for the additional expenses that provinces and territories face as a result of an aging population. We'll continue to work with provinces and territories to ensure those health care needs are met.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: With all respect, Mr.Chair, that is a little disappointing. While the leader of the NDP wants the federal government to interfere massively in provincial jurisdiction over health, the Prime Minister replies in English. That is perfectly legitimate in this Parliament, but his reply in English is, no, the government absolutely respects provincial jurisdiction. That made me happy for a brief moment, and I am asking the Prime Minister, without wanting to interrupt his precious reading, to please repeat in French was he said just now in English, that he absolutely respects provincial jurisdiction over health, which is exclusive. So could you please provide that music to my ears?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, just as I respect the member opposite's right to speak in his first language, I hope that he understands that I am trying to learn our second official language in a high-pressure situation, and it often creates anxiety. I will tell him, though, that we fully respect the jurisdiction of provinces and territories to address the needs of their constituents and their members, and we work very closely with Quebec and with all provinces and territories to make sure that the funds we transfer from the federal government can be utilized in a way that best meets the needs of their constituents.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Let's not get into that. It says to me that French is the second official language. Well, it's my first official language and it's the first one in Quebec. I would like to have heard that in French. I would like to have heard it from the Prime Minister, because it's a constitutional issue. Basically, you could say that it's our heritage. So that is what I would like to have heard. Let me proceed with a short and simple question: is health in the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces in the current crisis management situation?", "Hon. Pablo Rodriguez (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons): Mr.Chair, I would like to tell my colleague that we have no first or second official language. We have two official languages. They have the same value and the same importance. They deserve the same respect in the House and in the institutions of the government. We are always happy to collaborate with the provinces and to respect their jurisdictions.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: Hearing that we have no first or second official language is better already. Between friends, let's say that they are equal. Let us take it one step further: is health in the jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, we live in a federation where we work closely together with provinces and territories so that we can reach our mutually important goals, one of which is that all citizens of Canada, all members of Canada, have access to a public health care system that meets their needs. We continue to work within the constitutional framework", "The Chair: Excuse me, but I have to interrupt you. Mr.Blanchet, you have 21seconds left.", "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet: The answer could be even shorter than the question. Is health in provincial jurisdiction? Will there be an increase in the health transfers and will they come without conditions?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I am sure the member would argue that it is important to work together. The federal government transfers money to the provinces, as he is well aware, to deliver health care, which is within each province's and territory's jurisdiction.", "The Chair: We now move to Mrs.Gill.", "Mrs. Marilne Gill (Manicouagan, BQ): Thank you, Mr.Chair. As the member for Manicouagan, I would like to address the House today on a matter that is very important in my constituency. At 350,000square kilometres, it borders the Gulf of St.Lawrence. Regionally, I am also in eastern Quebec, which includes the Gasp, the Magdalen Islands, and the Lower St.Lawrence. These are regions whose economy rests basically on two very important seasonal industries: tourism and fishing. Make no mistake, it is not the workers who are seasonal, it is the industry itself, as our former leader Gilles Duceppe so rightly used to say. Those industries are very important for that region of Quebec, but I see no measures to support them that accommodate all their uniqueness. These are cyclical industries, meaning that they operate at a very specific period during the year. A few minutes ago, I heard the Prime Minister say that he had intervened to help the companies and the workers in those seasonal industries. I would like to know what the specific assistance is and how it is tailored to the companies and the workers in the seasonal industries he mentions.", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr.Chair, I would like to thank my colleague for her question. We know that the current situation is causing upheaval in the lives of Canadians from one end of the country to the other and that it is having a major impact on our small and medium businesses. Since this crisis began, we have not hesitated to implement strong and speedy measures to support more Canadians. That is what we will continue to do. We know that the tourism sector is key to a number of communities in the country. We must help them to get through this crisis as best we can. We are continuing to have discussions and to tailor our measures so that as many Canadians as possible can take advantage of them.", "Mrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, with all respect, I am hearing that nothing has been done. Measures have been proposed, but, as I understand it, they are not specific to the seasonal sectors. Let us take the seasonal fishing industry. The fishers are currently going out, but right in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis. One fishing season has been pushed back. The same thing applies to tourism. The season will be pushed back, and it is possible that there may even not be one. The people and the companies in this sector have no second chances. They cannot start again in the fall. It's a bit like agriculture. They can't start a fishing season or a tourist season in the fall. So they need assistance. We have some proposals. For example, would the government be prepared to let the Canada emergency response benefit provide workers with eligibility to employment insurance benefits? They could then get through the coming year and make it to next season.", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr.Chair, I want to thank the member for speaking about the situation in all regions of Canada, particularly in Quebec. From the start, we've been implementing significant measures to support the millions of workers who are currently struggling. We've taken significant measures with respect to tourism, agriculture and regional development. We're providing broader investments, such as the wage subsidy and emergency loans for small businesses, of which there are many in my colleague's constituency. We'll continue to work very hard so that the workers and businesses in her constituency can get through this crisis and emerge stronger and more united.", "Mrs. Marilne Gill: Mr.Chair, that's strike two. This is the second time that I've asked a question about targeted assistance for the seasonal industry. My honourable colleague's response doesn't make me feel any better. The workers in the industry also don't feel any better when they see that, at the end of the summer, they'll have no job and no money to put food on the table. Will these workers receive assistance adapted to their needs? It's the same thing for businesses. We're currently talking about the businesses in my constituency, but there are also businesses in the East. Quebec and Canada as a whole, both in terms of fishing and tourism", "The Chair: The honourable President of the Treasury Board has the floor.", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Thank you, Mr.Chair. My colleague probably knows the information that I'll be giving. The Canada Emergency Response Benefit is available to all individuals who haven't been receiving employment insurance benefits since December2019. A number of stakeholders in Canada and Quebec called for this, particularly in the places", "The Chair: The next question goes to Mr. Singh.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. The Prime Minister announced the business bailout, and in that proposal, he said that there would be limits on CEO bonuses and share buybacks. By saying limits, the Prime Minister is suggesting that there would be some amount of bonuses or share buybacks that could be paid for with public dollars. If that's the case, how much?", "The Chair: The honourable minister.", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we believe that it's very important that we support jobs. In that regard, we're trying to make sure that businesses can get through this time. As we provide that support, we've been very clear for large enterprises that share buybacks will not be allowed, period, and that there will, of course, be limitations on total compensation for senior executives in order to give Canadians confidence that we're doing the things we need to do to support them, but that we're not supporting executives.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, Germany has actually taken the lead and said that if a company wants public money, then its executives must commit to reducing their pay. Will Canada follow Germany to ensure that public dollars go to workers and not to enrich the executive suite, and commit that no public money will go to bonuses or increasing salaries for executives?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we are looking forward to releasing the complete details of the large employer emergency financing facility, and I think the member opposite will be quite pleased to see that we will be leading on behalf of Canada in advance of what Germany is doing.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, we know the PBO has said that $25 billion, at least, is being lost to our revenues because corporations are avoiding paying their fair share. Will the Prime Minister commit today very clearly that if a company is hiding its money by putting it in an offshore tax haven, that company will not receive public help, yes or no?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, again with regard to this program, we want to be very clear that the support that goes to large businesses actually supports their Canadian enterprises and their Canadian employees. In that regard, we will not allow any company that has been convicted of tax evasion to have access to these funds, and we will carefully evaluate on an ongoing basis to make sure that companies remain eligible for this support based on their continuing investment in Canada.", "The Chair: Mr. Singh.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, how many companies can the Minister of Finance name that have been convicted of tax evasion that would be denied help under this program?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I think what's most important is that we focus on Canadians. We're trying to support Canadians, whether they're working for small or large businesses, so they can get through this, can support their families during this time, and come out with a job at the end of it. That is exactly where our focus lies in this regard.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, not a single company. We are four years past the Panama papers and there hasn't been a single conviction. Those are simply fancy Liberal words saying that a company that has been convicted of tax evasion.... There are simply no companies that this government can give as an example. Why don't we follow what France has done and commit very clearly, not in Liberal fancy words but straight up, if a company is hiding its money by using offshore tax havens, it will not get public help. Will the minister commit to that right now?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we've been working with France and other countries to make these rules stricter for businesses. The process around the common reporting standard and the base erosion profit shifting has made it more difficult for firms to move money into tax havens, and it has ensured that we have transparency in seeing when they do so. We'll continue to do that hard work to make sure that businesses abide by the rules and pay their appropriate part of taxes in our country.", "Mr. Jagmeet Singh: Mr. Chair, let's talk about hard work. If a company is not convicted of tax evasion, but is putting its money in Barbados or Bermuda, for example, specifically to avoid paying taxesand we have a similar example of Loblaws doing something like thiswill that company, despite not having a conviction, but clearly having avoided paying their fair share by putting their money in an offshore tax haven, receive help, yes or no?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I'd suggest that the member be very careful in accusing companies of wrongdoing. We have a country that respects international rules. We allow our companies to trade and do business around the world. That continues to be important, and that supports Canadian jobs. At the same time, we're trying to make sure those international rules work and get tighter. That's what we've been working on. We'll continue to do that because we know it's important that we can work internationally. It's important that companies pay their fair share here in Canada.", "The Chair: The next question goes to Mr. Hoback.", "Mr. Randy Hoback (Prince Albert, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. The Liberals hand-picked ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, stated that China's conduct during the pandemic is damaging to its own soft power. However, when asked if there should be an investigation into China's behaviour during the crisis, the health minister stated that's not for her to say because she doesn't have all the evidence about what China did or didn't do. Why is Canada's ambassador to China criticizing China's actions during the pandemic while this Liberal government is defending it?", "The Chair: The honourable Deputy Prime Minister.", "Hon. Chrystia Freeland (UniversityRosedale, Lib.): Mr. Chair, Ambassador Barton is an excellent representative of Canada in China, and he is a member of our government and very much shares and helps to formulate our government's policy when it comes to China. Ambassador Barton, of course, shares our government's view that a post-crisis review is absolutely necessary.", "Mr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, the government's March 27 duty deferral announcement has caused tension within the trade community. Customs brokers are being asked to shoulder tremendous liability as importers are not required to make duty payments until the end of June, when there is a real possibility that some of them may find themselves insolvent. Will the government commit to a liability exemption for customs brokers whose clients are unable to pay the duties at the end of June?", "The Chair: The honourable minister.", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we have worked hard to determine programs that we think can be supportive of individuals and businesses, including allowing for deferral of taxes through this period. That we believe is important with respect to the GST, which we've allowed to be deferred until July 1, and in terms of taxes for businesses, until the end of August. We think this helps businesses to get through this challenging time, and we'll continue to support businesses and individuals so we can have a strong economy when we get through this crisis.", "Mr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, the following three questions are from constituents in my riding, so hopefully, I'll get some good answers for them. The first one I'll talk about is Rick. He owns a small business, a local bowling alley, in Melfort. It's a family-owned operation, so he doesn't meet the payroll threshold for the wage subsidy benefit, nor does he qualify for any other announced loans or grants. There are businesses right across Canada that are in similar situations. Is the minister suggesting that they lie to get the funds, or will they make some changes so they qualify?", "The Chair: The honourable minister.", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: I want to highlight some of the initiatives we have put forward to assist small businesses. The Canada emergency wage subsidy covers 75% of the wages of employees, and that way they can maintain their jobs. We've also put forward the enhanced work-sharing program. It's an option for businesses to pay their employees. On top of that, I want to highlight the Canada emergency business account, which has issued 590,000 loans. As the Minister of Finance recently mentioned, we've deferred GST and HST and customs duty payments for businesses for the next three months.", "Mr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, Robert owns a cleaning products company in Prince Albert. He tells me that Canadian custodians and building service contractors are not purchasing Canadian-made disinfectants because very few are included in the federal approval list for COVID-19, even though Canada produces many products that Health Canada has certified as disinfectants. Why is the Liberal government not prioritizing the approval of Canadian-made products?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, that assertion is not correct. In fact, we have been working very closely with producers of Canadian products as well as with our colleagues at Innovation, Science and Economic Development to make sure that Canadian companies have what they need to very quickly move through the approval process. Health Canada has accelerated this process, and most companies can get approved in one to seven days. Of course, there is an iterative process that requires companies to ensure that a product is safe for use in Canada.", "Mr. Randy Hoback: Mr. Chair, last week the government announced $252 million in assistance for Canadian farmers, which was largely seen as an insult, especially given that a good amount of this money was already budgeted. A constituent of mine, Tracy, from Melfort, wrote to me asking me to advocate for farmers and ranchers so they can get the support they need to continue to produce our food. When will the government start to prioritize farmers and ranchers? Will they continue to reform the business risk management program?", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Absolutely, Mr.Chair. We're working very hard with our provincial colleagues to improve the risk management programs. We did announce programs last week, and some of these new programs are designed specifically for the meat sector. A total of $77.5million is earmarked for processors and $50million for beef producers.", "The Chair: The next question goes to Mr. Calkins.", "Mr. Blaine Calkins (Red DeerLacombe, CPC): Mr. Chair, provinces are reopening at different speeds, and that includes opening their provincial parks before the May long weekend. It no longer makes sense for fully staffed national parks across the country to be uniformly closed. Will the Minister of Environment commit to opening national parks in harmony with provincial and territorial parks across Canada?", "Hon. Chrystia Freeland: Mr. Chair, we are working very closely with our provincial partners on the reopening. I am pleased that we were able to publish, on Tuesday, April 28, shared guidelines on the reopening, which were supported by the Prime Minister and all of the premiers of the provinces and territories", "The Chair: Mr. Calkins.", "Mr. Blaine Calkins: Mr. Chair, boating is a safe way to enjoy the outdoors while maintaining physical distancing. Why is Parks Canada postponing the opening of lock operations and similar functions along our heritage waterways?", "Hon. Chrystia Freeland: Mr. Chair, as I was saying in my answer to the first question, the question of coordinating national and provincial parks is a very good one. That is something we are definitely working on.", "Mr. Blaine Calkins: Mr. Chair, since the beginning of this pandemic, the minority Liberal government has been actively trying to push our democracy aside. It severely limited parliamentary sittings, attempted to take executive control of tax rates and used an order in council to ban lawfully acquired and responsibly owned firearms. When will the government stop using this pandemic as an excuse to run roughshod over our cherished democratic values?", "Hon. Pablo Rodriguez: I don't understand this question at all, since we're meeting here to ask questions for twohours and 15minutes. That's the equivalent of three question periods. Yesterday, there was the equivalent of two question periods, and tomorrow there will be the equivalent of two more question periods. We're talking about seven question periods. That's more than normal.", "Mr. Blaine Calkins: Mr. Chair, the inconsistency in support for various sectors in our economy is baffling. There is more money made available to forcibly confiscate lawfully owned property than in emergency support for our hard-working farmers or our prosperity-creating oil and gas sector. The only consistent theme appears to be that sectors that do not traditionally vote Liberal are finding themselves left out in the cold. If that is not the case, why is there such an obvious discrepancy?", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Mr.Chair, those comments are completely unjustified. We're fully committed to our sectors, including the energy sector and the agriculture and agrifood sector. This is particularly important. These sectors are critical. That's why we're working to improve our risk management programs. We want to ensure that the criteria are broader and that more producers can benefit from these programs.", "Mr. Blaine Calkins: Mr. Chair, during the misinformation briefing, the public safety minister used Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom as examples for firearms policy. Does the public safety minister realize that these countries are islands and none share a border with anyone, least of which with the United States of America? Is my bringing this new-found evidence to the minister's attention going to change his focus to smugglers, gangs and criminals, instead of wrongfully blaming lawful gun owners?", "Hon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness): Mr. Chair, I would like to assure the member that I have actually seen an atlas. I want to be very clear that those countries have recognized, like Canada has, that these weapons have no place in a civil society. They were designed for soldiers to engage in combat with other soldiers. They were not designed for hunting and sporting purposes, which are the lawful uses of a firearm in Canada, but rather for individuals to kill other individuals. Tragically, in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, that is precisely what they have been used for, and we have prohibited", "The Chair: Mr. Calkins.", "Mr. Blaine Calkins: Mr. Chair, the nine o'clock gun is an iconic 12-pound cannon that has been fired daily in Vancouver in Stanley Park since the 1800s. It's now a prohibited firearm as of May 1, 2020. Can the minister advise the public of the safety risks that this cannon, which was manufactured in 1816, poses to the public?", "Hon. Bill Blair: Mr. Chair, I assume the member opposite is referring to the prohibition of grenade launchers. There are about 34 in Canada and we have brought in regulations that now prohibit grenade launchers. It does not apply to some of the other things that have been suggested by the member opposite.", "Mr. Blaine Calkins: Mr. Chair, I was referring to the iconic, heritage 12-pound cannon that is mounted on a pedestal in Stanley Park. It was manufactured in 1816. Any cannon that can be fired can be loaded with a projectile, so it meets the definition of a firearm, which means that every cannon in Canada, every heritage piece that might be in a museum, every heritage piece that might be in a collection, is now a prohibited firearm. Was the minister not aware of this when he announced this policy?", "Hon. Bill Blair: Mr. Chair, just to help the member opposite, let us be very clear. We have prohibited weapons that were unfortunately widely available in Canada and were being used for purposes other than sporting activities, which is the only use of a firearm in Canada, for either hunting or target shooting sporting activities. Rather, they were being used to harm individual Canadians and, in some tragic cases, many individual Canadians. We've done the right thing, Mr. Chair, and we", "The Chair: We'll go to Mr. Nater next.", "Mr. John Nater (PerthWellington, CPC): Mr. Chair, agricultural societies across rural Ontario are making the difficult decision to cancel their fall fairs this year. Some of these fall fairs have been around since before Confederation. Not only is this a terrible loss for these communities of important community events, but it's also putting a significant financial strain on these agricultural societies. What action is the government taking to support agricultural societies in Canada?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, what we've done is we've put forward monies to support our regional development agencies. These agencies have the mandate and the ability to support local initiatives, including the events the member has highlighted. This is more than doubling the budget that currently exists, so that we have sufficient resources to support communities and these very important local events.", "Mr. John Nater: Mr. Chair, the arts and culture industry has a massive impact on local economies. In my riding alone we have the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, the Stratford Festival, Drayton Entertainment and Stratford Summer Music. The postponement and cancellation of the seasons of these important cultural institutions is having a massive impact on the hospitality industry, including local restaurants, hotels and bed and breakfasts. Many of these businesses are small businesses and owner-operated businesses that are falling through the cracks in the government's programs that have been introduced. How will the government address the blind spot in their programs for small businesses in communities like this, which rely on the tourism and the arts and culture industries?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, clearly, we understand how important these organizations are to these communities. That is why we allocated $500 million to respond to the specific financial needs of arts, heritage and sports organizations, to help them be more resilient through this difficult time. Last week we rolled out the funding of this announcement, and we look forward to engaging with communities across the country.", "Mr. John Nater: Mr. Chair, 1.8 million jobs are attributed to the tourism industry in Canada. Among these, 740,000 are related to international travelling. No one wants to see the borders reopen until it's safe to do so, but can the government provide clarity on what criteria will be used to provide some information to these tourism operators of how, when and under what criteria international borders will be reopened?", "Hon. Chrystia Freeland: Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the member opposite for his view that we need to be cautious and prudent and put the health and safety of Canadians first. That is very much the view of our government as well. When it comes to international borders, the health and safety of Canadians is absolutely the first criterion we are going to look at. Of course, we will be looking at the situation with coronavirus", "The Chair: We'll go back to Mr. Nater.", "Mr. John Nater: Mr. Chair, many Canadians continue to fall through the cracks of programs announced by this government. One of my constituents only recently returned to the workforce after spending many years out of the workforce raising her children. As such, she doesn't qualify under the $5,000 minimum requirement for income over the past 12 months. How will the government address these people who are falling through the cracks?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr. Chair, we are mindful of the very difficult circumstances in which many Canadians who have a foot in two places find themselves. We have a number of different measures to help them and we're going to continue to do so.", "Mr. John Nater: Mr. Chair, it has been reported that as many as 15% of farmers and farm families in Canada could face going out of business and bankruptcy because of the massive impact that COVID-19 is having on agriculture in Canada. Business risk management programs are not working for these farm families, and the processing capacity is simply not there for farmers and for farm families, especially in the beef and pork industries. How will the government immediately address the short-term processing capacity issues found in the beef and pork sectors? When will they finally live up to the commitment of a complete review of the business risk management programs?", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Mr.Chair, I've been holding discussions with my provincial counterparts to review the risk management programs. With respect to the AgriStability program, we've offered producers some accommodations and pushed back the enrolment date to July3. We've also increased, from 50% to 75%, the advance payment that they can obtain quickly, in provinces where this is possible. We've also posted a calculator online. So before they say that the program isn't working, I encourage them to use this calculator to find out how much they can receive.", "Mr. John Nater: Mr. Chair, this government continues to show a blind spot for small businesses in Canada. Many don't qualify for the CEBA because they don't have a high enough payroll or because they don't have a business account. So many small businesses are falling through the cracks. Will the government expand the criteria so that small businesses in my community and across Canada can qualify for the important assistance they need at this time?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, I would like to remind my honourable colleague that we did expand the eligibility criteria threshold from $50,000 down to $20,000 so that more businesses could be eligible, and on the top end, for salaries, from $1 million to $1.5 million. That is why we have seen 590,000 small business loans issued. That's a testament to the program.", "The Chair: The next question will go to Mr. Maguire.", "Mr. Larry Maguire (BrandonSouris, CPC): Mr. Chair, hog and beef producers have seen drastic price drops. Producers are telling me that they would use the western livestock price insurance program if the premiums were affordable, which they are not. Will the Minister of Agriculture work with the industry to make the premiums affordable so that producers can have price protection against these market fluctuations?", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Mr. Chair, we're working closely with the industry and my provincial counterparts to identify the best programs to help producers in this difficult time. Last week, we announced specific programs for the meat sector: $77.5million for processors, $50million for beef producers and $50million for pork producers.", "Mr. Larry Maguire: Mr. Chair, Chez Angela Bakery in Brandon has seen tremendous success since it opened two years ago. Due to this growth and the eligibility criteria for the wage subsidy program, their revenues would have to decline much further than 30% in order for them to receive help. Will the Minister of Finance amend the eligibility for the wage subsidy program so that Chez Angela and similar businesses can apply?", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton (Simcoe North, CPC)): The honourable Minister of Industry.", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, I'd like to thank the honourable member for his question. I want to highlight the fact that we did make an amendment. When we originally proposed this initiative, the threshold was 30% for the month of March. Now businesses will only need to show a 15% decline in revenue, and businesses will have the option of using January and February as a reference period to show revenue losses, or of using the same time last year. This reflects, again, our ability to understand the needs of businesses, to act quickly and to make sure that they benefit from this very important initiative.", "Mr. Larry Maguire: They still don't qualify, Mr. Chair. The Blarney Stone restaurant in Killarney has repeatedly asked the Minister of Finance if they could refinance their loans through the Canada small business financing program. Will the Minister of Finance give small business owners the ability to refinance their existing loans through the program, yes or no?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, again, we've demonstrated flexibility and nimbleness when it comes to these financing options. I'd also like to highlight another very important initiative that was mentioned earlier, the deferring of GST/HST and customs duty payments for businesses for the next three months. This will help 3.2 million business owners and entrepreneurs across the country. Again, it's another initiative to put more money in the pockets of businesses as they deal with this unprecedented health care crisis.", "Mr. Larry Maguire: Mr. Chair, the Liberals still haven't fixed the payroll eligibility problems for many small business owners who need to access the zero-interest loans available in CEBA. Can the minister provide any rationale for why countless small businesses are not being allowed to access these loans?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, as of today, 590,000 small business loans have been issued. I think that's contrary to the point the member opposite is making. Clearly we recognize that we need to be agile and that we need to understand the needs of businesses. That's why we made changes to this particular program. We'll continue to listen to businesses. I can assure the member opposite that 590,000 small business loans is no small feat.", "Mr. Larry Maguire: Mr. Chair, Canada has some of the best competitive sport shooters in the world. The Liberals' order in council on firearms will put an end to many Canadians being able to represent our country. Can the Minister of Public Safety list even one of these sport shooting competitions, which will now be illegal due to his order in council?", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The honourable Minister of Public Safety.", "Hon. Bill Blair: Mr. Chair, it's an important question because sport shooting is a very important tradition for many Canadian sport shooters. I want to assure the member opposite that the weapons we have prohibited by this order in council were not designed for sport shooting and are not used in the Olympics or Paralympic Games. They are not included in this and therefore have no impact on that activity of legitimate sport shooting.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): You have time for one more short question, Mr. Maguire.", "Mr. Larry Maguire: Mr. Chair, statistics show that women are more likely to live paycheque to paycheque, so women continue to be disproportionately impacted by this pandemic in a negative way. Many are worried they won't have a job to go back to. Will the government commit to helping women who are bearing this financial burden return to the workforce?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr. Chair, this is a very good question. I would love to have a lot of time to answer it. The answer is yes, of course. We are making sure that many of our measures do not disproportionately impact women, because when women succeed, all Canadians succeed.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll now continue with Mr.Blanchette-Joncas.", "Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas (Rimouski-NeigetteTmiscouataLes Basques, BQ): Thank you, Mr.Chair. It's a privilege to be here in the House today to represent the people of Rimouski-NeigetteTmiscouataLesBasques, but also to serve as the BlocQubcois tourism critic. Tourism in Quebec is a significant economic engine and wealth creator. This industry is vital to the regions of Quebec, as I'll demonstrate. The tourism industry in Quebec generates over $15billion in economic spinoffs and employs more than 400,000workers. In Quebec, one in tenjobs is connected to the tourism industry. Every dollar spent on tourism generates about 70cents in the Quebec economy. The tourism industry consists of over 30,000businesses, and two-thirds of these businesses are outside the major centres in the Quebec City and Montreal regions. In the tourism industry, 82% of businesses have fewer than 20employees. This shows once again the need to support this industry. I heard my honourable colleague on the other side of the House say that a plan was in place for the tourism industry. I want to hear what he has to say about this plan. To date, what specific measures has the government taken to support the tourism industry?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr.Chair, I want to thank my colleague for his question. He's right. The situation is very difficult for all regions of our country and for Quebec. That's why we've invested in regional development. These investments will improve the situation in the tourism sector. These investments will provide assistance for festivals, programs and other initiatives. We'll continue to work with my colleague and the other members to find solutions that will improve the situation.", "Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas: Mr.Chair, I'm not sure that I fully understood the plan. However, I can say that the people in the tourism industry don't understand the plan, because they're still waiting for it. One issue in the tourism industry involves fixed costs. Initially, we asked that part of the wage subsidy be set aside to cover fixed costs. The government implemented the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance. The assistance covers 75% of commercial rental payments under $50,000, and property owners pay the remaining 25%. To date, how many applications have been submitted under this program?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: The wage subsidy is very significant. However, we know that there are other fixed costs. That's why we've taken other measures, such as the measures related to credit and rent. We've combined several measures that will help companies bridge the gap until the end of the crisis.", "Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas: We expect to hear a figure and not necessarily words. We could see that the program was ineffective, particularly for seasonal businesses, including businesses in the tourism industry. Businesses need to have suspended operations or to show a decline of at least 70% in operations since the start of the public health crisis. How can a tourism business that hasn't yet launched operations show a decline of 70%? It doesn't make sense. A recent survey conducted by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business shows that only one in ten businesses can benefit from this assistance. Yet these businesses need the assistance. Does the government believe that commercial rent assistance is effective even though only one in ten businesses can benefit from it?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr.Chair, I know that the situation is very difficult. That's why we've introduced another option. Through the community futures development corporations and business development centres, we're providing $71million to businesses and organizations in rural communities by giving them much-needed access to capital. This investment will help many businesses in Quebec, particularly in the tourism sector.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr.Blanchette-Joncas, you have one minute left.", "Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas: Mr.Chair, in my humble opinion, one out of ten businesses amounts to 10%. This figure isn't very high and is far from a passing grade. What does the government plan to do? Does it plan to implement an expanded program to support businesses in the tourism and seasonal industries to ensure that fixed costs are more fully covered?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr.Chair, we have a strategy. We've invested in regional development and in small and medium-sized businesses. We've helped the workers and we'll continue to work with the provincial governments to find solutions. We must work together, particularly in the tourism sector, because the situation in the sector is very serious. I'm sure that we can find solutions to help improve the situation for people in the tourism sector.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We will now continue with Mr. Van Bynen.", "Mr. Tony Van Bynen (NewmarketAurora, Lib.): Mr. Chair, I would like to inform you that I will be splitting my time with the member for Kingston and the Islands. Mr. Chair, last week was Mental Health Week. We know that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a great deal of stress and uncertainty for all Canadians and that during this uncertain time, it is normal for many people to feel increased anxiety, depression and mental health issues. In fact, a poll by the Canadian Mental Health Association's Ontario branch showed that 61% of respondents were worried about the mental health of a loved one and more than half of the respondents were worried about their own mental health. In the Standing Committee on Health, we've also heard from many witnesses that our front-line heroes, working around the clock to protect us from the virus and to help others recover, are at great risk of physical and mental burnout. This shows how seriously Canadians need supports for their mental health and well-being during this most trying time. Can the Minister of Health tell my constituents what the government is doing to support Canadians during this uncertain time?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, I thank the member for NewmarketAurora for that very insightful question. In fact, we've been very worried about Canadians' mental health as resulting from the pandemic, but even prior to that we knew that we needed to create rapidly more tools for Canadians across the country, no matter where they lived. We've worked very closely with our provincial and territorial partners, for example, to amplify the work that they're doing through increased supports, financial supports. We also launched Wellness Together Canada, which is a digital portal, where all Canadians can get access to tools they can use to help with the circumstances they find themselves in and to get the information they need during COVID-19. It also allows Canadians to connect to paid professionals who can provide support in a variety of different ways, whether it's over the telephone, through email or by text, understanding that Canadians have different ways of connecting that work for them. We've also partnered with a number of organizations that provide supports to Canadians, many of the crisis hotlines, for example, that are working double-time or triple-time to try to keep up with the volume of demand. This is a difficult time for all Canadians and we will continue to work to ensure Canadians have the supports they need.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go to Mr. Gerretsen, from Kingston and the Islands.", "Mr. Mark Gerretsen (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.): Mr. Chair, students from across the country have been significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19. As we know, thousands of post-secondary students depend on employment throughout the summer in order to pay for expenses throughout their academic year. Unfortunately the pandemic has resulted in the closure of many businesses and organizations that would normally employ students who work during the summer. Thousands of students are now left without the financial means they were depending on to pay for their post-secondary educational expenses. In response to the concerns raised by students, the government announced the creation of the Canada emergency student benefit, which will provide students with the assistance they need to make it through these uncertain financial times. I represent a riding that has multiple post-secondary institutions, and my constituents have been asking when they should expect to apply for the Canada emergency student benefit. Can the President of the Treasury Board please give us an update on the status of the Canada emergency student benefit, and in particular, when students will be able to start accessing this benefit, and also confirm if and how it may be retroactive?", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr. Chair, I would first like to thank the member for Kingston and the Islands for his strong advocacy in favour of young Canadians in his riding and across Canada. Mr. Chair, our government is committed to ensuring that young Canadians have the support that they need during this very difficult time. That's why we are investing $9 billion to support students and recent graduates affected by COVID-19. The measures include doubling the Canada student grants, raising the cap on student loans, creating new employment opportunities for students and launching the Canada emergency student benefit. I'm pleased to share with the House that the application period for the Canada emergency student benefit will commence on May 15. That is this Friday. This benefit will provide $1,250 a month to eligible students or $2,000 for students who have disabilities or dependants. Mr. Chair, when Canada emerges from this pandemic, we want to make sure that students are in a financial position to continue their studies so that they can pursue fruitful careers and help build a strong Canada.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll wait a few seconds before moving on to the next five-minute period to allow the console operator to switch with someone else. We'll next go to the honourable member for Calgary Skyview, Ms. Sahota.", "Ms. Jag Sahota (Calgary Skyview, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. Victims of human trafficking continue to suffer during this crisis. Many are facing worse conditions and additional barriers to escaping human trafficking than before the pandemic. The government has been completely silent on this issue, and now funding to fight human trafficking is being taken away from front-line organizations. Why would the government choose to do this at this vulnerable time?", "Hon. Bill Blair: Mr. Chair, human trafficking is, as we all know, one of the most heinous crimes imaginable. Our government is working to eliminate all instances of it. To combat human trafficking, we've launched a comprehensive national strategy that brings together federal efforts under one strategic framework. We have backed that new move with $75 million in additional investments, and the new strategy now strengthens Canada's ability to fight this abhorrent attack on human rights and human dignity.", "Ms. Jag Sahota: Mr. Chair, this simply isn't good enough. The government is letting down our most vulnerable Canadians. We know that human trafficking hasn't stopped during this pandemic, and these front-line organizations have received the message that supporting them in fighting these heinous crimes is not a priority. What is the minister going to do to rectify this situation?", "Hon. Bill Blair: As I said, we have developed a national strategy to combat human trafficking. We've made $75 million in additional investments, and this new strategy takes a whole-of-government approach. It empowers victims and survivors to regain their self-confidence and control over their lives, and it will prevent more of these crimes from taking place. It provides better protection and support for those most vulnerable to human trafficking, and it will ensure that police and prosecutors have the resources to prosecute these traffickers for their heinous crimes. Mr. Chair, we'll continue to work collaboratively with victims groups and to provide the supports that are required.", "Ms. Jag Sahota: Mr. Chair, more vulnerable Canadians continue to be let down. There are effective medications that have been developed for those living with cystic fibrosis, yet this medication is not available here. We know that the pharmaceutical company has not been able to apply to market this drug in Canada because of the changes to the PMPRB, which have been heavily criticized by stakeholders and patients. Will the minister delay the July 1 implementation date and review the regulations so that drugs like Trikafta are made available in Canada?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: Mr. Chair, there are two separate issues in that question, so I will talk about the PMPRB. As a government, we are committed, as you know, to increasing affordability of and accessibility to Canadian medications, to medications across Canada, and the PMPRB regulatory amendments will help Canadians to be able to afford their prescriptions. Canada will continue to be an important market for new medicines. In fact, many countries with much lower prices for medicine gain access to new medicines in the same time frame as Canada, or even faster.", "Ms. Jag Sahota: Mr. Chair, for those living with a rare disease, every single day can be a struggle. We know the importance of lowering drug costs, but not at the cost of life-saving drugs not being available here in Canada. Waiting years for the government to reduce regulations is not an option. We also know that the nature of the disease makes those people more susceptible to contracting COVID-19, and they are at a higher risk of its being lethal. Why is this government continuing to let those with CF struggle and suffer needlessly?", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: I believe the member opposite is talking about the drug Trikafta, and many cystic fibrosis patient groups have been advocating having access to it in Canada. In fact, the manufacturer of Trikafta has not submitted an application to market this product in Canada. However, that said, we do have a special access program for drugs that are not marketed in Canada. As of May 6, Health Canada approved 95 applications for 98 patients to access Trikafta through the special access program. I would encourage all patients with cystic fibrosis to speak to their doctor to ensure that they too can apply through the special access program.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): You have time for one short question of 45 seconds.", "Ms. Jag Sahota: We know the importance of lowering drug costs. As you know, 4,300 people suffer from this rare genetic disease. Most of them are children and young adults. One young woman from Calgary is a CF champion, fighting for her passion to be a famous opera singer. She's very talented. Her reality of living with CF has meant that she has had many visits to the hospital and had many health crises that have made singing impossible for a time. CF patients are waiting for this drug, which was fast-tracked in other countries. Now it seems that the changes to the PMPRB will cause further delays or complications. Will the minister delay the implementation and review the PMPRB?", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Honourable Minister, please provide a short response.", "Hon. Patty Hajdu: I will just repeat that the manufacturer has not applied to sell this drug in Canada.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we will go to Mr. Lobb of HuronBruce.", "Mr. Ben Lobb (HuronBruce, CPC): Thank you very much. On July 25, 2019, after the federal-provincial-territorial agriculture meeting, the agriculture minister promised big changes in 2020 for programs like AgriStability and AgriRecovery. Besides a pilot program in a couple of provinces and an application deadline, is there anything else you would like to report?", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: Yes, Mr.Chair. Since the July meeting in QuebecCity with the provincial and territorial ministers of agriculture, we've been working to improve the AgriStability program. This issue remains a priority, and it's included in my mandate letter. However, at this time, we're responding to emergencies that go beyond what the various risk management programs can provide to our producers.", "Mr. Ben Lobb: You can appreciate, Minister, the issue we're dealing with here. The United States Department of Agriculture has allocated $19 billion to farmers, $16 billion of that in direct support. The program that was offered last week, $252 million, was a mere fraction of what the United States is getting. If the minister is telling farmers to bank on the existing business risk management program, it's not going to work. Countless numbers of pork farmers, just in my riding alone, have one thousand, two thousand, three thousand head of hogs ready to be shipped within the near future. They will lose $70 a head. AgriStability isn't going to cut it. We need an immediate program to help out these hard-working pork farmers.", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: I fully understand my colleague's comments. That's why we announced specific programs for the meat sector: $77.5million for processors, $50million for beef producers and $50million for pork producers. We've also increased, improved and facilitated access to AgriStability. One pork producer tried the calculator and told me that he could quickly receive $11 per head of hog. Alberta's agriculture minister even publicly stated that some producers could obtain the desired amount of $20 per head using the AgriStability program.", "Mr. Ben Lobb: Mr. Chair, you can see the problem right there with the math. The minister just said that one of her pork producers is going to get $11. They are losing $70. There's a $59-per-head gap, times likely several thousand head of hogs in their barns. Let's go to another trying issue with agriculture. It's the carbon tax. I know that the government has their position on the carbon tax, and I know that I'm not going to change it, but I want to give the members of Parliament across the way, the government, an idea of what a pork farmer might go through. A pork farmer sent me their bill for February 26 to March 24. Their natural gas bill was about $2,400. In there was close to $500 in federal carbon tax. Farmers manage their woodlots ethically. They have environmental farm plans. They have nutrient management plans. They get no credit for any of the carbon sequestration and ethical environmental management on their farm, yet every month they are asked to pay a carbon tax. It just doesn't seem fair. I want the minister's opinion on that.", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: As you know, our pollution pricing policy is designed to build a clean economy. We've introduced exemptions for agriculture. On one hand, emissions from animal and vegetable production are not subject to carbon pricing, and on the other hand, farm fuels and other fuels delivered to off-farm points-of-sale are exempt. We've also provided partial reimbursements for propane and natural gas used in commercial greenhouses. We have already done a lot. We encourage producers to take advantage of the business risk management programs, and we are ready to do more. We've already shown that, and we will continue to do so.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): There is time for one short question and response. Go ahead, Mr. Lobb.", "Mr. Ben Lobb: Mr. Chair, I know the Minister of Agriculture has toured my riding. She knows very well what the lay of the land is here. What about pork farmers? What about chicken farmers? What about hens? What about drying in the fall? All those farmers pay a carbon tax, and there is no program for them. They pay and they pay and they pay, and what makes it worse is that they are given no credit for the environmental work they do on their farms.", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: It's true that our producers work incredibly hard to protect the environment and ensure the well-being of their animals. That's important, to be sure, but I'd like to put the impact of pollution pricing into perspective. To put these estimates into context, AAFC used data from agricultural tax data programs to show the impact on a per-farm basis as a percentage of total operating costs. The estimates ranged from $210 to $819 per farm and 0.05% to 0.42% of total farm operating expenses.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We now move on to Mr.Lehoux.", "Mr. Richard Lehoux (Beauce, CPC): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Being from a rural area, myself, I can assure you that people who live in rural communities are resourceful and resilient. Instead of staying cooped up in their homes, they are doing their best to retool and save the companies they work for. One of the only options they have is to work from home. Unfortunately, though, they don't have access to the tools they need. Cellular and Internet networks are inadequate, even non-existent in some cases. I want to know, not whether the government is going to help these Canadians join the 21st century, but when. Can you give us any assurances and, above all, a timetable for a real plan?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: I agree with the member. The situation is very serious. High-speed Internet is not a luxury; it's a necessity. That's why we launched the connect to innovate program. My fellow minister Ms. Monsef will be introducing the next strategy to improve the situation in all regions, especially rural areas. Finding a solution is absolutely imperative.", "Mr. Richard Lehoux: I don't think the minister understood my question. In the 2019 budget, the government promised to connect all Canadians to the Internet by 2030. This is 2020. That's 10years away. People don't need reliable Internet service 10years down the road. The pandemic has made the need even more acute right now. When, then, will people have Internet access? I'm simply asking you for a date now.", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr.Chair, under the last budget, we launched a $1.7-billion program to support broadband infrastructure. That's a lot of money for high-speed Internet. My fellow minister Ms.Monsef is in charge of the program. We also introduced the connect to innovate program, which has helped 900communities all over the country. We will keep working to make the lives of people who live in rural areas better, and we will find solutions to provide high-speed Internet access.", "Mr. Richard Lehoux: Mr.Chair, you no doubt know that Beauce is the cradle of small and medium-sized businesses. On March27, the Prime Minister introduced the emergency wage subsidy to help businesses cope with the pandemic. Unfortunately, general partnerships were overlooked. Of the many constituents in my riding who have reached out to me on the subject, one, in particular, has contacted me three times since mid-April. I still don't have anything to tell him because the government is dragging its feet. We'd like to get a clear and specific answer. The same goes for sole proprietors, who were also overlooked. When is the government going to include these businesses in the current programs?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr.Chair, we announced in financial support for vulnerable small and medium-sized businesses that are not eligible for the measures already in place and that are struggling with cash flow issues. We've also invested $71million to support businesses and organizations by giving them access to capital in rural communities. As well, we've invested in programs for rural areas, and we will continue to make investments to help small and medium-sized businesses.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr.Lehoux, please keep it brief.", "Mr. Richard Lehoux: All right, Mr.Chair. The Canadian Federation of Agriculture asked the federal government for an agriculture and agri-food emergency fund of $2.6billion to help maintain food security in Canada in response to COVID-19. Will the minister address the federation's request? Minister, I'd like you to give us a date.", "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau: We already have a host of business risk management programs, through which, $1.6billion is available to producers annually. More support is actually available, even through those programs, since they meet the demand. We are prepared to do more, and we will. I urge producers to apply for the AgriStability program and to use the funds in their AgriInvest accounts. Some $2.3billion is available through that program.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll now go to the honourable member for LangleyAldergrove, Mr. Van Popta.", "Mr. Tako Van Popta (LangleyAldergrove, CPC): Mr. Chair, the government's wage subsidy program is designed to help traditional companies, not high-growth companies. For example, I was talking to Ron, who operates an engineering firm in my riding that specializes in designing and building very expensive machines for their ever-expanding overseas markets. Business is down, but not by the requisite 30%. Of course not, since they're in high-growth mode, but just recently they had to lay off some very talented staff. Can the minister confirm that the wage subsidy program can be expanded or adapted to deal with high-growth companies that will play such a key role in Canada's economic relaunch?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, my honourable colleague is absolutely correct. We, the government, take enormous pride in our small businesses, particularly the start-ups and the high-growth firms. They're going to be absolutely essential for our economic recovery, and we know that some of them are ineligible for the wage subsidy. That is why we introduced a $250-million program in the industrial research assistance program through the National Research Council, strictly targeting and focusing on those high-growth firms that were ineligible for the wage subsidy, so that they can provide the wage support to keep those highly skilled individuals in Canada.", "Mr. Tako Van Popta: Mr. Chair, there is another category of businesses that are falling through the cracks and feel they are being left behind by the wage subsidy program. Those are recently merged companies. For example, there is a trucking company in my riding that is significantly bigger this year than it was last year as a result of some key acquisitions and mergers late last year. All of the legacy companies by themselves would qualify individually for the wage subsidy, but the merged company does not. Can the minister confirm that the wage subsidy program is sufficiently flexible to accommodate recently merged companies?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: Mr. Chair, again I want to thank my honourable colleague for his question. He is identifying unique pain points that exist within the overall economy with specific examples of companies that are not able to access some of the programming we have provided. I do want to highlight, when it comes to the wage subsidy, that we have made changes to the revenue thresholds to make more companies eligible. The specific example that the member opposite raises is something that is under consideration.", "Mr. Tako Van Popta: Mr. Chair, the government's commercial rent assistance program discriminates against certain tenants based solely on whether their landlord has a mortgage on the subject building. I was talking to Leslie the other day. She manages a number of commercial office buildings in my riding. Some of these buildings have mortgages and some don't, and it all depends on what they were able to negotiate with their banker. Leslie is having a very hard time explaining to her tenants why some will qualify for the rental subsidy and some won't, depending on which building they are in. Can the government confirm that the nonsensical mortgage requirement in the rent subsidy program is gone?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the approach that was taken on trying to assist small businesses with rent is very much based on the fact that this is a provincial jurisdiction, so we have used the mortgage system as a way to do it. It is, in fact, not nonsensical. That said, we are looking at this particular issue. It's something that is under consideration. We expect that we will find a way to ensure that those landlords who don't have mortgages can work with the CMHC to have the appropriate approach to be eligible for this program.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): You have about one minute left, Mr. Van Popta. Go ahead with a short question.", "Mr. Tako Van Popta: Many people in my riding have reached out to me to say they are quite disturbed that their favourite hunting and sport shooting firearms are now on the banned list. Can the minister inform Canadians how many Canadian taxpayer dollars are going to go to the buyback program for legal gun owners and how far that money would go if it were to be diverted to something useful, such as more border controls to stop the illegal importation of firearms?", "Hon. Bill Blair: Our first priority is the protection and safety of Canadians. We've seen an unacceptable rise in gun violence right across our community. All weapons are being regulated in our country. Some, such as handguns, represent such a significant risk that we strongly restrict them. Some weapons, quite frankly, are completely unsuitable for any sporting or hunting activity, such as weapons designed for soldiers to engage in combat with other soldiers. We have now prohibited those weapons. The saving of lives is worth an investment in public safety. I want to assure the member we will bring forward legislation that will facilitate an appropriate buyback program. I look forward to a discussion in this House with the member opposite on how that can be done to ensure public safety and to ensure that we do it in as effective a way as possible.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll now go to Mr. Manly.", "Mr. Paul Manly: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to thank the government and ministers present for the rapid relief that they've provided to Canadians. I know the constituents in my riding really appreciate that. I'd like to thank them also for being responsive to the MPs who have brought forward gaps in the program. The CERB requirements recognize dividend income for eligibility for the Canada emergency business account, CEBA, but the Canada emergency business account does not recognize dividends or contract payments. I've been contacted by many small business owners who have been legally paying themselves with dividends for years, but these companies cannot apply for the CEBA even though this might save them from bankruptcy during this crisis. Will the government make the necessary changes to allow dividend income to be admissible for CEBA eligibility?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: I'd like to thank the honourable colleague for his very thoughtful question and his advocacy in looking for different solutions and in working with us to help small businesses, not only in his riding but across the country as well. He's absolutely correct that the Canada emergency business account has been successful, as 590,000 loans have been issued. That's a reflection of some of the changes that we introduced, which made the criteria more generous so that more businesses could obtain assistance. He has raised the issue of dividends. As I said before, we continue to work with Canadians and Canadian businesses and colleagues in this House to see how we can assist more Canadians, not less of them, and we'll continue to endeavour to do that.", "Mr. Paul Manly: Mr. Chair, there are still many Canadians stranded overseas who are trying to return to Canada. Some have no assurance that their non-Canadian spouse will be allowed into Canada with them. Many are being forced to make an impossible choice between sheltering in place overseas or separating from their spouse in order to return home. Will the government remove unnecessary barriers and allow these Canadians to return to Canada immediately with their spouses?", "Hon. Bill Blair: Mr. Chair, in an effort to flatten the curve and to protect Canadians, we've taken a number of extraordinary measures at the border and we have restricted non-essential travel of people coming into Canada. While Canadian citizens and permanent residents will always be admissiblesubject, of course, to a 14-day quarantine upon entry foreign nationals are subject to travel restrictions. For individuals to be eligible to travel to Canada, their travel must be considered essential travel, consistent with the emergency order put in place. I recognize and very much respect the spirit of the member's question. We recognize these are difficult situations. It is not our desire to keep families apart. I want to assure that each situation will be decided on a case-by-case basis based on the information made available to border service officers. I welcome any inquiries he may have. If he reaches out to my office, we'll help in any way we can.", "Mr. Paul Manly: Mr. Chair, the Alberta energy regulator has suspended a wide range of environmental monitoring requirements for oil sands companies during this pandemic. This includes environmental reporting. It includes wetland wildlife and bird monitoring, even though Canada is a signatory to the international migratory bird treaty. Water that escapes from storm ponds doesn't need to be tested. Air quality programs, including for first nations communities, have been reduced. Testing for leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, has been suspended. This is after the federal government has provided $750 million in funding for methane emission reductions. The federal government has also just committed $1.7 billion to clean up orphaned oil wells. That message, clearly, is about the negligence of the Alberta government. It is something corporations should be paying for. Will the federal government hold the Alberta government to account and withhold energy sector relief funding until these environmental regulations are reinstated?", "Hon. Chrystia Freeland: Mr. Chair, I'd like to thank the member for his question and for his very collaborative approach with our government on a number of issues. I would like to thank him for this particular question and his particular reference to methane, because it gives me an opportunity to highlight some very important progress that the federal government made this week in working with the Province of Alberta. Just yesterday Alberta joined B.C. and Saskatchewan and published its own draft regulations on methane. This will allow us, in working with Alberta, to work on equivalency on methane, which will allow us to work towards standing down the federal system in those jurisdictions. This is tremendously important, because it will allow us to cut methane emissions by 45% by 2025. It's hugely important for fighting climate change together.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we'll go to the honourable member for Hamilton Mountain, Mr. Duvall.", "Mr. Scott Duvall (Hamilton Mountain, NDP): Mr. Chair, I was pleased to hear about extending the tax deadline to October 1 in yesterday's announcement for seniors. After many discussions with the Minister of Seniors, I was glad to hear that she was listening to the NDP and many others on making this happen. It stops a lot of interruptions for people who couldn't get their taxes done. Mr. Chair, COVID-19 has been showing us in stark terms that Canadian seniors are struggling to make ends meet in Canada. Before enduring the crisis, it was clear that OAS and GIS benefits levels were just not enough for seniors to keep up with the cost of living, so we need to fix this now. Why is the government refusing to increase OAS and GIS benefits to lift seniors out of poverty on a permanent basis?", "Hon. Deb Schulte (Minister of Seniors): Mr. Chair, I want to thank my honourable colleague for giving me this opportunity to rise today and talk about how we are supporting Canadian seniors during this pandemic. Many Canadian seniors are facing significant health, economic and social challenges as a result of the pandemic. They built this country and now they need our help. Our government is taking significant action to provide Canadian seniors with greater financial security and give them the help they need during this crisis. We're building on past measures by introducing a one-time tax-free payment of $300 for those who receive OAS and of $200 for those receiving GIS, totalling $500 to seniors who receive both. We are also supporting community-based projects to improve the quality of life for seniors through the New Horizons for Seniors program, and investing in other charities. Seniors need our help, and we are delivering for them.", "Mr. Scott Duvall: Mr. Chair, I was glad to hear that the Minister of Seniors is acknowledging the financial burden that our seniors are taking on. She mentioned the prescription dispensing fees, the added costs of their groceries and the delivery charges. I was glad that the Prime Minister acknowledged the heavy toll seniors are facing, and that they helped to shape this country and now they need our help. A surprising statement that I heard yesterday was the Treasury Board and the seniors minister's admission in their press briefing that the level of assistance being provided to Canadian seniors is quite low. Why is the seniors minister acknowledging all the burdens they're trying to help the seniors with, but the response they're giving is just a very low way of handling it?", "Hon. Deb Schulte: I really do want to acknowledge my honourable colleague for his advocacy. I just want to assure him that while the government remains committed to implementing policies in our platform, we are focused on this health crisis right now. We have provided financial support to seniors sooner through the GST credit top-up, and now with additional payments to OAS and GIS recipients. This year we are investing over twice as much on financial assistance for seniors as we committed to in our platform, which is $3.8 billion compared to $1.56 billion in the platform. Seniors need our help and we're delivering. These payments have provided greater support for the most vulnerable seniors. Just to give some details, for those on OAS and GIS, they will get, in conjunction with the GST credit top-up, $875 per adult, and over $1,500 per couple. This is not an insignificant amount. This is a significant amount to support our seniors during this pandemic.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): You have about one minute left for both a question and a response. Go ahead, Mr. Duvall.", "Mr. Scott Duvall: Thank you, Mr. Chair. The minister was talking about there being a maximum payment, if it's possible. What I've heard from seniors is this is a one-shot deal and it's an insult to them. They want some stability on an ongoing basis. We did make an agreement about two weeks ago that help would be implemented without delay on the seniors issue and for people with disabilities. Why did yesterday's announcement include only the people who are seniors, but not people with disabilities? Why have they been omitted? When can they expect help to come?", "Hon. Deb Schulte: I just want to touch on the two points raised. On the one-time payment, we know that seniors need help now, and that's why it's important to get that money into seniors' accounts as soon as possible. That is why we're providing the one payment right away, instead of small amounts spread over months. In the coming weeks we will look at additional supports for other vulnerable Canadians. I just want to let him know we are working on additional measures.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go now", "Mr. Scott Duvall: I didn't hear anything about the disability", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The five minutes are finished.  It is now over to Mrs.Gill, the member for Manicouagan.", "Mrs. Marilne Gill: Thank you, Mr.Chair. I'll be sharing my time with the member for Rimouski-NeigetteTmiscouataLesBasques. I have just one question. It's for the government, and this will be the fourth time I've asked today. When I go back home, what am I going to tell the people of Chandler, Amqui, Bic, Saint-Simon, Tadoussac and Harrington Harbour? Am I going to tell them that the government supports the Bloc Qubcois's proposal? We propose giving seasonal workers access to employment insurance benefits until next season, regardless of whether they received the CERB, how many hours they worked or how many they accumulated. Should I instead tell them that the Liberal government has nothing in store for them as they suffer through the crisis? The government hasn't managed to bridge the employment insurance gap, and is even planning to bring it to six, if not eight, months. That means they'll have nothing to put on the dinner table for the next year. I'd like an answer, Mr.Chair.", "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos: Mr.Chair, I have three things to say in response to the member's important question. First, we obviously understand what she's saying. The work is seasonal, not the workers. The work they do is fundamental so they can support their families and their communities in eastern Quebec and other regions. Second, the CERB delivers significant assistance to those often vulnerable workers, the majority of whom would be able or certainly eager to find another job. Third, and finally, before any longer-term investments are made, it's important to keep in mind that those who may have received employment insurance benefits but who lost them in recent weeks or who do seasonal work are eligible for the CERB. That said, we are also looking ahead. We've already announced some very important measuresand we'll continue to do soin support of tourism, culture, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and many other key contributors to regional development in Quebec and elsewhere.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The member for Rimouski-NeigetteTmiscouataLesBasques, Mr.Blanchette-Joncas, has the floor.", "Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas: Mr.Chair, the situation my fellow member just described is of little comfort to those in Quebec's regions. To be frank, the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance program is a flop. According to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, one in three businesses doesn't qualify for rent relief because it doesn't meet the 70% drop in revenues requirement. Half of businesses have indicated that their landlords won't be applying for the program because it's optional. Commercial landlords can choose to participate in the program or not. How is that going to help businesses, Mr.Chair? We are still trying to figure that out. Businesses, especially seasonal ones, need more support to cover their fixed costs. Will the government commit to reviewing the program, which is too restrictive for businesses and optional for landlords? The program must do more to help businesses, particularly seasonal ones, cover their fixed costs.", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr.Chair, we know that businesses are, of course, very concerned about fixed costs. Our rent relief program is very significant. We haven't yet announced all the details, so it's much too soon to say that it's flawed. More information will be available in the next few days. At that point, we hope to be on the right track when it comes to fixed costs and rent.", "Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas: I hope you're making adjustments. It's totally unacceptable that only 10% of businesses who need the relief can get it. What's more, the public health crisis has brought its share of change for businesses, particularly with the new health measures. They have to plan, implement preventative measures, have response plans, train staff and acquire the necessary equipment. In order to do those things, protect the public and reopen their doors, businesses have to assume the costs. Will the government commit to providing financial assistance to businesses, especially those in the tourism industry, so they can cover the costs of putting the new health measures in place?", "Hon. Navdeep Bains: I know the situation is very serious in rural communities. That's why we've invested $71million in community futures development corporations, or CFDCs, and business development centres. Both of those will go a long way towards helping businesses in rural communities, and I have no doubt that we will continue working together to find other solutions.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Now we'll move on to the honourable member for Calgary Centre, Mr. McLean.", "Mr. Greg McLean (Calgary Centre, CPC): Thank you, Mr. Chair. One of the terms for accessing the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance, CECRA, is that you must have a mortgage on the property. One of the key terms of eligibility for this support is that the landlord owes money to a bank. Will the Minister of Finance tell us if this program was designed for the benefit of landlords and tenants or for the benefit of banks?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I appreciate the question from the member opposite. I think that it's important to know that commercial rent and landlord-tenant relationships are provincial jurisdictions. Therefore, as we embarked on an approach that could enable landlords and tenants to get to an agreement that would help both, we used the CMHC as a vehicle from which we could do that. We think that we've come up with a program that provides advantages for the landlords and advantages for the tenants, and we will be announcing details that will include how mortgages can be put in place for those landlords who don't currently have them.", "Mr. Greg McLean: Brookfield Properties, a large Canadian firm, announced that its rent collections on commercial properties for April were 15% of the lease terms. Luckily, Brookfield has another company, Brookfield Business Partners, poised to help by buying up the distressed equity of the firms that owe them money. Did the Minister of Finance design CECRA with this outcome in mind, washing out individual investors and small companies and transferring that value into the hands of vulture financiers who hold all the cards?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: In fact, Mr. Chair, we designed this program exactly with the idea in mind of the challenge that we're seeing. We're seeing that in many cases commercial tenants are not actually able to pay their rent, so landlords are not getting the rent that's due. Therefore, there's a mutual interest from tenants and from landlords in coming to an agreement. By providing funding through the mortgage system to those landlords, we recognize that we'll enable both of those two parts of the equation to come to an agreement that we think will be advantageous for the sector over the long term.", "Mr. Greg McLean: In the past two months, the Bank of Canada has tripled the size of its balance sheet to almost $400 billion, with more to come, Mr. Chair. In the 2008 recession, the world's major economies endured quantitative easing on a previously unknown scale, most of which has not since been unwound. Canada endured a then-record $50-billion deficit, but we did not need to enter the uncertain world of QE, quantitative easing, as a result of the strength of Canada's oil and gas industry. Will the minister acknowledge that this government's oil and gas policy mismanagement has led to economic decline, necessitating hundreds of billions of dollars of quantitative easing?", "Hon. Chrystia Freeland: Mr. Chair, let me challenge one assumption implicit in the honourable member's question, the assumption that our government fails to understand the importance of the oil and gas sector to our economy. Let me quote some leaders from Alberta and their response to the lease program. Tim McMillan, CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said, I think this is essential. Not all companies are going to need to tap into this sort of liquidity...but some that are normally high-quality, stable companies likely will be looking for this program to provide a certain amount of liquidity for them. CAPP understands that we are supporting Canadian companies, including in the oil and gas sector, and I would urge the members opposite to understand that as well.", "Mr. Greg McLean: BlackRock is one of the world's largest investment companies, managing trillions of dollars of bonds. It has lobbied regulators around the world to not be named a systemically important financial institution. The Bank of Canada unexpectedly engaged BlackRock as an adviser on its bond-buying plans. Is the Minister of Finance mindful of the conflict of interest that exists between the world's largest bond manager, BlackRock, and the advice it's giving the Bank of Canada on buying bonds?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the member opposite might know that the Bank of Canada is independent from the government, and as such we are not privy to those decisions and support the continuing independence of the Bank of Canada from the government.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr. McLean, you may have just a short question.", "Mr. Greg McLean: The finance sector seems to be getting well served during this economic crisis. Will the minister endeavour to provide a more balanced program of benefits going forward for the sake of the entire Canadian economy, and not just the Brookfields, the BlackRocks and the big banks?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I think the notion that one sector is being advantaged versus another actually defies the facts. More than 550,000 loans have gone out to small businesses in the form of $40,000 loans per business over a very short time period. Canada is a leader in this regard, and we'll continue to support businesses all across Canada with loans and support as they need it to get ourselves through this difficult time.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): We'll go to the last five-minute round. We'll begin with the honourable member for Carleton, Mr. Poilievre.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: Thank you, Mr. Chair. What is the dollar value of the total assets of the Government of Canada?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, earlier today we were given incorrect information on the Auditor General. I would like to be able to provide more information at my next response.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the member for Carleton said that the previous government spent more on the Auditor General than the current government, and that is actually incorrect.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, in fact, in the last full year of the Harper government, in 2014-15, the total spending on the Auditor General was $85.8 million.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, in the most recent year, 2018-19, the total spend was $92.4 million for the Auditor General, showing a 7.7% increase.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: What are the total liabilities of the Government of Canada?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I would just say it's shocking when people bring forward incorrect information to the House to try to make a point.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: What are the total liabilities of the Government of Canada?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we will continue to support Canadians through this time, with support not only for businesses but for individuals to get through and get a bridge to a better time.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: What is just the dollar value?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, that's a continuing commitment.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: I know we shouldn't ask the minister about numbers. He's just the finance minister, after all, but what is the equity on the Government of Canada's balance sheet?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I would advise the member for Carleton to memorize those Auditor General figures for his next foray into the House of Commons.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: The minister has claimed that our balance sheet is strong. There are three components to a balance sheet: the assets, the liabilities, and the equity. The minister doesn't know any of the three, so clearly he doesn't actually know anything about our balance sheet. That's reassuring. According to the Auditor General, the negative net worth of our Government of Canada will be as much as $1 trillion by the end of this fiscal year. Can the minister, if he is familiar with any of these numbers, tell us if it is possible that his government will hit $1 trillion of debt this year?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I want to assure Canadians that our approach will be to continue to make investments on their behalf. That is available to us because of our strong fiscal position, but we will continue to take that approach, which we think is the appropriate one.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: Will it be $1 trillion, yes or no?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, as I said, we will continue to focus on the importance of supporting Canadians.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the size of our current national debt?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I think what will happen as we do that is that we will allow ourselves to have a stronger economy at the end because of these investments.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the size of the national debt?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: We have always seen, Mr. Chair, that these investments are not only supporting Canadians; they are supporting businesses so that we do have a strong economy and a strong fiscal position coming out of this.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: Does the finance minister know the size of our national debt?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I will continue to focus our efforts, as we believe we should, on supporting Canadians through this time.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: Does the finance minister know what $1 trillion is?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we are continuing to make investments that we believe are prudent in the face of this economic challenge, supporting Canadians as we know we need to.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total dollar value of all the public and private debt in Canada?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, we know that by supporting Canadians, by continuing to make investments, we will enable Canadiens to have less debt themselves because that", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): Mr. Poilievre.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: What is the total debt, public and private, as a share of GDP in Canada?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, the important consideration here is that the federal government is taking a position that we should support Canadians so that they don't take on the debt themselves.", "Hon. Pierre Poilievre: Yet they have. They have record household debt, record corporate debt and growing government debt. The finance minister doesn't seem to know any of the basic numbers that would be required to govern the finances of the Government of Canada, so I will give him one last chance. Based on his latest briefings, what is the total size of Canada's national debt? If he doesn't know, can he have the humility and honesty just to say so?", "Hon. Bill Morneau: Mr. Chair, I want to thank the member for slightly more time in this response to say that we think the best thing to do during this time period is to invest in Canadians. We know that in that way they will not be supporting as much debt themselves. The government is in a fiscal position that enables us to take on debt at this time, which we think is appropriate to get our economy to a better position at the end of this crisis. We think that's appropriate. We will continue to take that approach.  Some hon. members: Hear, hear!", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): The hon. government House leader is rising on a point of order.", "Hon. Pablo Rodriguez: I have a point of order, Mr.Chair. I think we need to keep the interpreters in mind and the work they are doing, particularly when it comes to the flow and speed of questions. As the interpreters have already mentioned, they've suffered more injuries during this short time than during all of last year. Mr.Chair, I kindly ask that you make sure members take that into account. Thank you.", "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton): I'm not sure whether that constitutes a point of order, but it's certainly an important reminder for members of the House to respect interpreters' working conditions. Please note that this is the end of our questions to ministers for this afternoon. Honourable members, please note too that pursuant to an order made on April 20, the House has been recalled. As such, the committee will now adjourn and the House sitting will begin shortly thereafter. The bells will be rung to call in members, and a parade will begin the sitting.

Um what was it , there was  there was some  some  some point where  eh uh Eric or somebody was  was speaking and he had lots of  silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else uh  which was in the background and it was not  it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech  on the close   close mike .", "Grad F: Hmm .", "PhD B: Oh the  What we talked about yesterday ?", "Professor A: Yes .", "PhD B: Yeah that was actually my  I was wearing the  I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me ,", "Professor A: Oh you  it was you I was Yeah .", "PhD B: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words .", "Professor A: Yeah .

The question is is can we learn from that  to change some of the other methods we have , since  I mean , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that  that it  it um  the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on uh a  a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than  um just assuming  that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength  towards uh it being this phone or that phone . Right ? So it  so um  he 's got these um uh uh", "PhD B: Hmm .", "Professor A: he \" AND 's \" between these different  features . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in  in principle  you  you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different  soft \" OR 's \" across the different uh  multi - band channels . And um  the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \"  \" AND ' ed \" things  is something that 's kept  uh as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is  is uh  taking  the phone target and then just back propagating from that", "PhD B: So he doesn't have", "Professor A: which means that it 's   it 's uh i It could be for instance  that for a particular point in the data  you don't want to um uh train a particular band  train the detectors for a particular band . You  you wanna ignore  that band , cuz that 's a  Ban - band is a noisy  noisy measure .", "PhD B: Mm - hmm .", "Professor A: And we don't  We 're  we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well  well as it can at predicting . Uh . Maybe that 's not the right thing to do .", "PhD B: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or  Ho", "Grad E: F right , and uh he doesn't have to have hard labels .", "Professor A: Well at the  at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's  where it 's sonorant . But he 's  but what he 's - but what he 's not training up  uh what he doesn't depend on as truth is", "Grad E: Right . For the full band .", "Professor A: um I guess one way of describing would be if  if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ?", "Grad E: Right .", "Professor A: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . So", "PhD B: Mm - hmm . OK .", "Professor A: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band  towards making your decision . And um  uh we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should  you should use everything  uh with  with uh equal strength .", "PhD B: I see .", "Professor A: And uh because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had  uh enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the  if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But um this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from  from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the", "PhD B: So where did he get his  uh his tar his uh high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ?", "Grad E: From uh canonical mappings  um at first", "PhD B: OK .", "Professor A: Yeah .", "Grad E: and then it 's unclear um eh", "PhD B: Using TIMIT ? or using", "Grad E: using TIMIT", "PhD B: Uh - huh .", "Grad E: right , right .", "Professor A: Yeah .", "Grad E: And then uh he does some fine tuning um for um special cases . Yeah .", "Professor A: Yeah . I mean we ha we have a kind of  iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi , uh so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's  it 's not  I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this  cuz then whatever  that alignment is , it 's that for all  all bands .", "PhD B: Mm - hmm .", "Professor A: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate  tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . Um . But it 's still  not quite the same because then it 's  it 's um setting targets based on where you would say  the sound begins in a particular band . Where he 's s this is not a labeling per se . Might be closer I guess if we did a  soft  soft target uh  uh embedded  neural net training like we 've done a few times uh  f the forward um  do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those . Mmm . Uh what 's next ?", "PhD B: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with .", "Professor A: Oh . You 're playing ?", "PhD B: I um Huh ?", "Professor A: You 're playing ?", "PhD B: Yes , I 'm playing . Um  so I wanted to do this experiment to see um  uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this um  I think I sent around last week a   this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where  I would take the um  the original um the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then uh do the same thing for  the ICSI - OGI front - end .", "Professor A: What  which test set was this ?", "PhD B: This is  that I looked at ?", "Professor A: Mm - hmm .", "PhD B: Uh I 'm looking at the Italian right now .", "Professor A: Mm - hmm .", "PhD B: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've uh  been able to go through from beginning to end the um full HTK  system for the Italian data and got the same results that um  that uh  Stephane had . So um I started looking  to  and now I 'm  I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to  uh to improve it . So . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use  the same number of states for all of the models", "Professor A: Mm - hmm .", "PhD B: and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits", "Professor A: Mm - hmm .", "PhD B: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits . Um you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a  an HMM system is that you use  um three states per phone and um  so then the  the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Um .  Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use  uh models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . They 've got those initial and final null states . And so um   their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five  which um , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each .", "Professor A: Mm - hmm .", "PhD B: And so they had sixteen . So that 's pretty close . Um   but for the  most of the words are sh much shorter . So the majority of them wanna have nine states . And so theirs are s sort of twice as long . So  my guess  uh And then if you  I  I printed out a confusion matrix um  uh for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that  you know , if you assume a fixed  the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states ,   uh you 've got  you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case ,", "Professor A: Mm - hmm .", "PhD B: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many .", "Professor A: Mm - hmm .", "PhD B: So  it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's  because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So um I 'm going to try to um create more word - specific  um uh prototype H M Ms to start training from .", "Professor A: Yeah , I mean , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the  for the longer word ,", "PhD B: Mm - hmm .", "Professor A: but .", "PhD B: Yeah so I 'll  I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just um you know create  uh models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be .", "Professor A: Mm - hmm .", "PhD B: And as part of that um I wanted to see sort of how the um  how these models were coming out , you know , what w  when we train up uh th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the  uh what do the transition probabilities look like  in the self - loops ,  look like in  in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can  calculate the expected duration of an HMM just by looking at the transition matrix", "Professor A: Mm - hmm .", "PhD B: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up ,", "Professor A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .", "PhD B: you know , the long ones versus the short ones . I d I did  quickly , I did the silence model and   and um that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the  string of digits .", "Professor A: Wow . Lots of silence .", "PhD B: Yeah , yeah . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I  I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but um . So they basically  their   their model for a whole digit string is silence  digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . And so .", "Professor A: Are the SP 's optional ? I mean skip them ?", "PhD B: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it .", "Professor A: Mm - hmm .", "PhD B: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's  it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot", "Professor A: I see .", "PhD B: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own  um It doesn't require its own training data ,", "Professor A: Mm - hmm .", "PhD B: it just shares that state .", "Professor A: Mm - hmm .", "PhD B: So it , I mean , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but um i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know  how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the  the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of  just from looking at the  durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening .", "Professor A: Yeah , I mean , I think that uh , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky .", "PhD B: Mm - hmm .", "Professor A: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z", "PhD B: Yeah .", "Professor A: The premise is kind of you have a  a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ?", "PhD B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .", "Professor A: And uh", "PhD B: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th um  the  the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . So they 're fairly , you know , hefty models . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application ,  you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . So in fact what we may want are simpler models .", "Professor A: Could be .", "PhD B: And compare how they perform to that . But  you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have .", "Professor A: Right . And that , I mean , at the moment that 's not the limitation , so .", "PhD B: Mm - hmm .", "Professor A: I mean , I  I  I  what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . You know , so .", "PhD B: Yeah . Right .", "Professor A: Uh  that 's another parameter , right ? that  that maybe , you know , uh  you really want three or nine or", "PhD B: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing  I mean , if I  if  if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models  that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians .", "Professor A: Right .", "PhD B: So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system .", "Professor A: Yeah . Yeah . But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things", "PhD B: Yeah .", "Professor A: how much better can you make it ? And um since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation", "PhD B: Mm - hmm .", "Professor A: um so", "PhD B: Right . Right .", "Professor A: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually .", "PhD B: Mm - hmm .", "Professor A: Doesn't have to go down .", "PhD B: Yeah . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet ,", "Professor A: Mm - hmm , OK .", "PhD B: I was just gonna change the  the t", "Professor A: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah .", "PhD B: yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens .", "Professor A: Yeah .", "PhD B: So .", "Professor A: Cool . OK . So uh  what 's uh I guess your plan for  You  you  you guys ' plan for the next  next week is  just continue on these  these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and", "PhD C: Yeah , I guess we can try to  have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . with all these minor things   modified . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and  retry the MSG and things like that .", "Professor A: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah we  we have a big list .", "PhD C: Big list ?", "Professor A: You have a big list of   of things to do . So . Well that 's good . I think  that after all of this uh um confusion settles down in another  some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and  hopefully it 'll have some effect from something  that   that has uh been done by our group of people but uh e even if it doesn't there 's   there 's go there 'll be standards after that .

We will not use teletext .", "User Interface: Oh .", "Marketing: Okay .", "Project Manager: Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext .", "Industrial Designer: I I disagree , but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree I guess .", "Project Manager: Well  the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_", "User Interface: Oh .", "Project Manager: and they don't want it , because of our time we have for this project .", "Marketing: Alright .", "Industrial Designer: Oh , alright .", "User Interface: Oh , that's a shame .", "Project Manager: So that's a shame , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point . Um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it .", "Marketing: Yeah . But let's forget about it . It's just time-consuming ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: so we uh have to go on .", "Project Manager: Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um  Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company .", "Marketing: Yes .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , we are a  real fashionable company . I read uh I read it on the", "Project Manager: Yeah .  Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: I didn't know what company we were ,", "Marketing: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Okay .", "Industrial Designer: So it has to be uh a modern design . That's important to know , uh when you design a thing of course .", "Project Manager: Yes . I I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have , our company . It's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: So maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something .", "Marketing: Right .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: You want to start ?", "Marketing: Yeah .  I think I have to start .", "Project Manager: Oh you have to start ? I didn't see anything about uh who had to start .", "Industrial Designer: The order ? No .", "Marketing: Oh no , no problem .", "Project Manager: Well s then start .", "User Interface: Mm .", "Marketing: I I just have to uh to think which file's mine ,", "Marketing: 'cause I was uh bit in a hurry .", "Project Manager: Okay . Well uh", "Marketing: I think it's this one . But I'm not sure .", "Project Manager: You already uh opened uh PowerPoint .", "Marketing: Hmm ? Yeah . S Right .", "Marketing: Yes . This is it .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: Um to start with these points . Uh next sheet ? Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . Uh , furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use .  Um then I tell something about um the most important issues . So we have to focus on those three thing three things . And in the end I'll um show you our target  audience or our target product users , customers . Well ,  um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly .", "Marketing: That's seventy five per cent of the current users . They don't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . Um  They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control .  Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . Furthermore , it's uh  seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb .", "Industrial Designer: You can zap away . Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah , yeah right .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: Right . A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their  in their living room .", "Marketing: So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily .", "Project Manager: Well", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: I dunno , maybe that's an idea .", "Industrial Designer: Oh .", "Marketing: 'Cause it's uh a big  I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room .", "Industrial Designer: Oh ?", "Project Manager: It should actually uh  It should actually be loose from the television ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: because it can also be used for other televisions . So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it .", "Marketing: Yeah but what if you lose your click-on device ?", "Project Manager: No you can click it on your television .", "Marketing: Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ?", "Project Manager: Yeah in another room , yeah .", "Project Manager: Well yes .", "Marketing: Nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: So  Well a beeping device would be", "Project Manager: Well we'll have a look at it , yeah .", "Marketing: Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn . So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it .", "Industrial Designer: I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . Uh", "Marketing: Yeah but people don't read manuals .", "Industrial Designer: I didn't read it ?", "User Interface: No .", "Industrial Designer: Oh , alright .", "Marketing: No .", "Industrial Designer: users to uh add one ? Do you think ?", "User Interface: I don't think", "Marketing: I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual .", "User Interface: Yeah . Yes you should  You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Yep .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah alright . Because they don't use it ? Alright .", "Project Manager: Well there sh should always be a menu ,", "Marketing: Yeah . Right .", "Project Manager: but it c can be very short .", "Marketing: And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes .", "User Interface: Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think .", "Project Manager: Yes okay .", "Industrial Designer: Well maybe for the  If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I don't know it ?", "Marketing: Alright .", "User Interface: Yeah right . It sh it should be there , the manual . But but not to explain how the remote works . Only", "Marketing: And we don't have much time . So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than  I think .", "Project Manager: Well we are a design team ,", "User Interface: Hmm .", "Project Manager: we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point .", "Industrial Designer: Isn't it part of the of the u", "Marketing: Yeah right , right .", "Project Manager: So", "Industrial Designer: No . No . Never mind .", "Project Manager: Well we'll have a look . Um yes ?", "Marketing: Next point . Um R_S_I_ .", "Marketing: Well that's about twenty per cent I thought . But uh the designer should uh take it uh  should uh  Wie zeg ik dat ? Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote .", "Industrial Designer: Consider the m Yeah .", "Marketing: It should be a good in your hand .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Yep .", "Marketing: Right , this is the most important part . Um , we're  Like the requirements said , we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience . Um ,  that's about sixty per cent of the market , so it's uh quite important . Um research shows that they like to have a little LCD screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . Uh  I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that .", "Project Manager: Well", "Marketing: So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs .", "Project Manager: Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we can't uh afford an LCD uh", "Industrial Designer: It's going to be expensive . Yeah .", "User Interface: No .", "Marketing: Yeah but  they think it's really important .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: So if we want to s If we have a big   If we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , I dunno . We have to uh", "Project Manager: Well", "Industrial Designer: Well we'll uh consider it uh .", "Project Manager: Yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh", "Industrial Designer: We'll think abo we'll think", "Marketing: Yeah , I don't know . I don't have any information on that . So", "Project Manager: Nigh", "Project Manager: I know .", "Industrial Designer: No , we'll look we'll look into that later . Alright ?", "Marketing: Right . And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . They also like that ,", "Marketing: but research is very uh costly . So", "User Interface: I think that's uh difficult to realise also .", "Marketing: Yeah , but  it  it might be important for the sale .", "Industrial Designer: We have very demanding clients .", "Project Manager: It's not yet a standard uh development uh those so", "User Interface: No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think .", "Project Manager: We sh", "Marketing: Well I do think LCD is more reachable than the speech recognition .", "Project Manager: Yeah absolutely .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: So we might consider LCD screens .", "User Interface: No .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , alright . Well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , I think .", "Project Manager: Yep .", "Industrial Designer: We don't rule them out uh yet .", "Marketing: Alright .", "Project Manager: 'Kay .", "Marketing: Alright . Um , I think that's it . Um", "Project Manager: Alright .", "Marketing: I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes .", "Project Manager: Yes .", "Marketing: So you can  Right .", "Project Manager: Well you  I c I can uh still see your presentation .", "Marketing: Yeah . Right .", "Project Manager: It's in the  Well uh next um I dunno who is next .", "User Interface: Oh you go .", "Industrial Designer: Shall I give a technical talk ?", "Project Manager: Yes .", "Industrial Designer: Alright .", "Project Manager: Well go ahead .", "Industrial Designer: Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design .", "Project Manager: Yip .", "Industrial Designer: We have that here . Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the", "Project Manager: F_ five .", "Industrial Designer: F_ F_ five .", "Project Manager: F_ five .", "Industrial Designer: Yep .", "Industrial Designer: Well , the working design ,", "Marketing: Alright .", "Industrial Designer: that's my uh", "Marketing: Next button .", "Industrial Designer: Well alright uh , you know who I am and what I do . So uh we have this . It's a bit uh unclear because I wanted to copy paste something . It was originally in black and white", "Marketing: Oh right .", "Industrial Designer: but it became black and purple .", "Marketing: Purple  .", "Industrial Designer: But I think you can read it .", "Marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah . A bit .", "Industrial Designer: Um well um I think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . Uh well you can see uh", "Marketing: Maybe you can select it . So it uh inverts .", "Industrial Designer: And I then can select I can select on the dings  It goes to the next page .", "Marketing: the p the whole picture .", "Project Manager: Click .", "Marketing: Nah , uh never mind .", "Industrial Designer: Well , you can read it ,", "User Interface: Yeah , go ahead .", "Industrial Designer: it's not too difficult . Meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set .", "Marketing: Yeah . Alright .", "Industrial Designer: And uh the source is of course the user . Uh the user interface is um  uh the  the  the buttons of course .", "Industrial Designer: And the  the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver . That's the that's the basic idea .", "Project Manager: Yep .", "Industrial Designer: Very basic .", "Industrial Designer: Um well I have uh  uh  put it in a in in in a  a couple of basic steps .", "Industrial Designer: Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed . The key  a signal to a chip , uh the chip senses the connection .  uh and recognise the key . So  well you understand .", "Industrial Designer: The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course .", "Industrial Designer: Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the TV set ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: and the TV set uh also recognises the the  the signal , and performs the assigned task .", "Project Manager: So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that . And a button for TV . So", "Industrial Designer: Ah bu Yeah , but we don't . Uh we", "Industrial Designer: No no , but  Yeah . Exactly . Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote .", "Industrial Designer: I've some couple of pictures here . It's a very basic one . And uh  if we if we're going to add an uh an uh LCD screen to it , it uh won't look anything like this , but  This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . It has uh very little buttons and", "Industrial Designer: But it it uh it's it's quite um  Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . They're uh far enough apart and an anything . It's not very um uh not very high-tech uh", "User Interface: High tech .", "Industrial Designer: indeed , and it's not very user-friendly . Uh if you look at the shape , it's uh just a simple long box uh shape . So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur .", "Marketing: Right . Can I say something ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . Well teletext is not an option , so that uh", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately", "Marketing: Right . Make them big , make them easy to uh to press .", "Project Manager: Well but but", "User Interface: You can also like", "Industrial Designer: You don't have to look and and search for them .", "Project Manager: if you have um the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same um well moves .", "Marketing: Right .", "User Interface: Yeah , I was thinking you can", "Marketing: Yeah , right . Right .", "Project Manager: But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands ,", "Project Manager: and that's on of the things about R_S_I_ .", "User Interface: Are some of the the the um", "Marketing: Yeah , that's right .

That's very important . And", "User Interface: Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some", "Project Manager: Yes I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons .", "Marketing: But is that is that useable ?", "User Interface: Hmm ?", "Marketing: Do people , uh when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ?", "User Interface: Well", "Marketing: It's a f it's a new feature ,", "Project Manager: Well it it's", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it .", "User Interface: Yeah alright , but", "Project Manager: Well also i if someone puts  picks up his uh remote", "User Interface: Yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they'll understand it  , I think .", "Project Manager: Yeah .

Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah but", "Marketing: Right , continue .", "Industrial Designer: But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb .", "Marketing: Sorry .", "Industrial Designer: I think that's a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , because uh they don't use it uh all the time . Well it's uh pretty pretty  basically uh as you said .", "Project Manager: Yep .", "Industrial Designer: And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh I don't want to get too technical ,", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you .", "Project Manager: That's your part of the job .", "Marketing: Yeah , that's right .", "Industrial Designer: So yeah  exactly  this is uh how it uh looks from the inside .", "Project Manager: Yep .", "Industrial Designer: And uh well that's about it I think . Oh yeah , I still have this .

Uh", "Project Manager: How late is did we start his presentation uh ?", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Marketing: I dunno . I think uh w About twenty minutes ago ?", "Project Manager: Wha Yeah .", "Marketing: Losing time losing time .", "Project Manager: Well then we have still the time , so   But we do have to come to a decision , right later on .", "Marketing: Yeah right . So", "Project Manager: So", "User Interface: Mm .", "User Interface: Well I thought um everybody on the website  uh would see the same thing , but obviously  that's not the case .", "Marketing: I don't think so .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , uh there are different uh  We have all have different home pages , with different links .", "Project Manager: Oh yeah ?", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah right .", "Project Manager: Uh ?", "User Interface: For instance you couldn't see this .", "Project Manager: Okay , yeah well .", "User Interface: Um  Yeah . Well I'm Mike  , User Interface Designer .", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: The the method ? Well  I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: Um", "Marketing: These are already in use ?", "User Interface: Yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer .", "Marketing: Alright , okay .", "User Interface: Um  This one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: Um", "Marketing: Well", "Project Manager: I like user-centred .", "Marketing: Yeah , me too .", "User Interface: I like user-centr centred uh  uh also the best .", "Project Manager: Yeah . We also do that .", "User Interface: Um  Well , I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff .", "Marketing: Mm .", "User Interface: Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one .", "Marketing: But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ?", "User Interface: But  Yes .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel .", "Marketing: Alright .", "User Interface: Um  I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need .", "Marketing: Yeah , right .", "User Interface: I um I kinda like the shape .

Something like that ,", "Project Manager: Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front .", "User Interface: in the  Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah . Yeah , yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: Those kind of things .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: But let's not focus on the front  .", "Project Manager: Yes . Okay .", "User Interface: Um  Well so uh uh like I said I thought we'd we'd use more function . If we we had to include more functions . But we don't .

Fo Yeah , critical .", "Industrial Designer: The younger uh", "Marketing: So  The younger audience .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "Marketing: So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people .", "Project Manager: Well what if we um  I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip ,", "Marketing: Mm-hmm .", "Project Manager: a f a little uh  You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh  uh", "Marketing: Clip aren't used much .", "Project Manager: Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m um a lot ,", "Industrial Designer: No um mm usually", "Marketing: Yeah right .", "Industrial Designer: But", "Project Manager: but not", "User Interface: Yeah , but what kind of features ? Like LCD screens and voice recognition .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah I think  m most", "Marketing: Yeah but  Yeah .", "User Interface: But I've", "Industrial Designer: Most uh", "Marketing: Here , look at these numbers . The newest features are , like I said , are uh LCD and uh speech uh control . Our audience , these people , are very like these uh features .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm . Uh .", "Marketing: You see ? So we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent .", "Project Manager: Competitors .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Our competitor . Yeah .", "Marketing: The concurrent ?  Competitors , right .", "Marketing: So , I do think we have to uh have some features .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Well maybe w we could uh s", "Marketing: Even though they cost a little more .", "Project Manager: On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little LCD th that you can click on or something ,", "Marketing: Right . Right .", "Project Manager: or that you can click uh out uh of the remote .

And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you're currently watching .", "Marketing: Yeah , right . Yeah right .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah . So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your LCD screen .", "Project Manager: For example . It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it .", "User Interface: Yeah , we should keep that simple too .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: It will", "Industrial Designer: But should it uh really be uh clickable , uh", "Project Manager: Well maybe .", "Marketing: No not clickable .", "User Interface: No , it should be uh integrated .", "Industrial Designer: or  or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy .", "Marketing: Nah , no no no .", "User Interface: I think", "Marketing: Yeah , just at at the top . So when you s  you sit like this you can can watch .", "Project Manager: Yeah . Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah ,", "Marketing: I think it should be at the top .", "User Interface: something like on um some radios in car . You  Where it's , yeah , walking to  Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah right . It's a ticker-tape idea .", "Project Manager: R_D_S_s or something .", "Industrial Designer: But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and  that kind of thing .", "User Interface: Wa Yeah .", "Project Manager: Well I think it's you got  It just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling ,", "Marketing: Well it's just one script .", "Project Manager: and it's not uh  That's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh", "Marketing: Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: So I don't think that's the issue .", "Project Manager: No .", "Industrial Designer: Alright .", "Marketing: Alright , we go with the LCD screen ?", "Project Manager: Uh well I think so , yes . Um", "User Interface: Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost .", "Marketing: 'Kay .

Yeah right .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue .  Where is my presentation ?  Uh", "Marketing: Yeah , I understand what you're saying .", "Project Manager: Uh", "Marketing: We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look .", "Project Manager: Well  I mean we're all here now , I think . These I've already given you . So we have to decide on the different remote control functions . So we want to have a small LCD screen that's special .", "Marketing: Right . At the top .", "Industrial Designer: Shouldn't we start with the most important parts ?", "Project Manager: Yes .", "User Interface: At the top or at the bottom ?", "Industrial Designer: The LCD screen alright  but we should start with the power button ?", "Marketing: I think the top is more uh", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Uh", "User Interface: Yeah but", "Marketing: When you s How do you zap ?", "Marketing: You just sit in your chair ?", "Industrial Designer: Huh ?", "User Interface: Yeah but with with the LCD screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural .", "Marketing: With the remote ?", "Project Manager: That thing is terrible .", "User Interface: 'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom .", "Marketing: Yeah but that's where your hand ball might be .", "Project Manager: Uh", "User Interface: Yeah , no Mm .", "Marketing: Yeah , I dunno .", "Industrial Designer: And then uh", "Marketing: We'll draw two , and then we'll see uh", "Industrial Designer: Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here .  I dunno what uh you were talking about but", "Marketing: No", "Industrial Designer: we are busy with something  .", "Marketing: Um he thinks  Yeah , right . He thinks it's better to put the LCD at the bottom , and I think it's better at the top .", "Project Manager: Well", "Industrial Designer: Uh-huh . Why do you think it's better at the bottom ?", "User Interface: Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody .", "Marketing: But your", "User Interface: I c", "Industrial Designer: But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there's room for the for the interface .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: Well I d I think that's that's ugly but", "Marketing: The the ticker  The LCD is like like small .  It's it's wide .", "Industrial Designer: Uh-huh .", "Marketing: It's not not high . But", "Project Manager: Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point ,", "User Interface: I th", "Industrial Designer: And and we can", "Project Manager: because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom .", "User Interface: Yeah . Power button always  Yeah . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Bottom .", "Project Manager: So and and I I like to use the ones on the top .", "User Interface: Yeah , y you gotta zap like this or  you want to  Yeah .", "Project Manager: So when I u when I have to have an LCD s scr window", "Marketing: Yeah right . But  We're making a remote with  with a few functions you know .", "Industrial Designer: Well  that's  a bit exaggerated . Well , I agree with you  . It's it's also more recognisable .", "Marketing: We", "Industrial Designer: It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top .", "Project Manager: Yes but we we we we don't want that .", "User Interface: Yeah you don't want", "Project Manager: We don't want them to look like a calculator .", "User Interface: You want uh  Yeah it it it must be a remote .", "Project Manager: We want to look it like our original but familiar", "Industrial Designer: Yeah w well ,", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe  important aspect like familiarity uh completely away ,", "Marketing: High-tech  .", "Project Manager: Yea", "Industrial Designer: uh because  I think it's uh", "Project Manager: Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh   We White ?", "Industrial Designer: I think it's still important to have it at the top ,", "Marketing: Width .", "Project Manager: Width . Uh format yeah format ? Line width ? Width ?", "Industrial Designer: because it's uh it's more familiar that way .", "Marketing: Th that's not a problem .", "Project Manager: Yeah ?", "Marketing: When I draw here it", "Marketing: Oh . Huh ?", "Project Manager: It's a bit off .", "Marketing: Yeah , it's off .", "Project Manager: Well .", "Industrial Designer: A little a little bit .", "Marketing: It  it needs to be calibrated again .

You e you only have one pen for that screen . Yeah .", "Marketing: Where ?", "Project Manager: It's special pen .", "Marketing: Alright , we have to make a decision now ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: because we don't have much time .

I I agree .", "Project Manager: I think it should be at the button , bottom . Bottom . The LCD .", "User Interface: At the bottom ?", "Industrial Designer: Well I'm the  I I'm the designer , so um", "User Interface: In a few minutes", "Marketing: At the bot", "User Interface: Oh yeah , oh yeah , I totally agree . Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: So  We are two uh V_S_ two .", "Project Manager: Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions ,", "User Interface: He's the boss .", "Project Manager: and then look at the design .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Right . Great .", "Industrial Designer: Uh we uh we were busy with that .", "Project Manager: Because we have to decide this .", "Industrial Designer: Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So , we have the power button .", "Marketing: And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the LCD s .", "Project Manager: Yes .", "Marketing: It's uh your it's your job .", "Project Manager: Well we have a power button .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah of course . Uh it's uh . Yeah . W wh", "User Interface: No it's our job .", "Project Manager: Guys ?", "User Interface: For all of us I think .", "Industrial Designer: While you have to agree , I can say  it's like this and  you must agree . Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah , right .", "Project Manager: Guys ?", "Marketing: Alright , let's keep it central .", "Project Manager: We have a power button , setting buttons , LCD window , the number buttons", "User Interface: The ten numbers ? Yeah ?", "Industrial Designer: Channel , yeah .", "Project Manager: Uh", "User Interface: Volume ?", "Industrial Designer: Volume control .", "Project Manager: Yes .", "Industrial Designer: Um", "Project Manager: Uh the mute button .", "Industrial Designer: Well let's look at your uh design . Uh", "Marketing: Mm .", "Project Manager: I h love that one .", "Industrial Designer: Uh-huh .", "User Interface: I think we we should use something like this um to um  The the channel up and channel down button ?  Yeah , in circle , you know ?", "Project Manager: Yes . Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . Well that's that's also design .", "User Interface: And and a volume control also in it .", "Project Manager: Yes . Um", "Marketing: Right .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Well h ho", "Industrial Designer: But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a D_V_D_ player or something . So", "Project Manager: Yes . Yes . They are for some uh video uh", "User Interface: Yes , as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons .", "Marketing: You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance .", "User Interface: Yeah . I think these should be in one big circle in the middle .", "Marketing: Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was  t kinda true . When   when you uh put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time ,", "Marketing: and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about . So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other .", "Project Manager: Apart . So people have to move their hand . And they get less uh complaints of R_S_I_ .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah , it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand .", "Project Manager: That's what I always do ,", "Industrial Designer: Y", "Project Manager: because all my i important buttons are the same place .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . It's good to move uh from time to time . Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yes ?", "User Interface: Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place .", "Marketing: Um", "Project Manager: Well not", "User Interface: They they need to be centred .", "Industrial Designer: No but now y W would we have to choose a way in middle ?", "Marketing: Frequency of uh button use .", "Project Manager: Yes .", "Marketing: Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour . You can see .", "Project Manager: Uh-huh .", "User Interface: Volume hardly .", "Marketing: So the the  channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down .", "Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm .", "User Interface: No I don't think .", "Industrial Designer: Oh .", "Project Manager: Up and down far apart from each other ?", "Industrial Designer: Far apart ?", "Marketing: You thinking uh about R_S_I_ ?", "User Interface: Yeah but", "Project Manager: Well not too much .", "User Interface: Yeah but", "Marketing: Y look at uh look at the frequency .", "User Interface: No .", "Marketing: Nei not too much , but", "User Interface: The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important . So", "Industrial Designer: I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together .", "Project Manager: Well for example the power button , you can", "User Interface: Well they are used four times an hour , so", "Project Manager: If someone is constantly z zapping , it's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it . Because I have someone  But the buttons is way .", "Marketing: Nei nei nei n I I totally agree .", "Project Manager: So that one can be put away .", "Marketing: But just  Yeah . Right . Yeah . I agree .", "Project Manager: The power button can uh be uh uh", "User Interface: Power bu button should be left at the top .", "Project Manager: Yes .", "Marketing: And should and should be red .", "Project Manager: Oh man ,", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Project Manager: five minutes .  Yeah , well five minutes left .", "Marketing: Right , just make some decisions .", "Project Manager: Yep .", "Marketing: The most important things we have to uh", "Project Manager: Um how are we going to do it with those numbers ?", "Industrial Designer: C c can you make you make  We can use uh the drawing board now , I think . Uh it it doesn't work well but  But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing .", "Project Manager: Well I have it here . Yeah well that's going to take too too much time .", "Marketing: I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now .", "Project Manager: Yes .", "User Interface: Mm . Yeah .", "Marketing: Just uh you decide that , you decide that ,", "Industrial Designer: Mm . Alright .", "Project Manager: Yes .", "Marketing: and  ready .", "Project Manager: Well the LCD . Um you are Industrial , you are User Interface . So I think it's going to go to Mike . But you will have to make consensus with  .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Well", "User Interface: Well consensus , um  We we can put it in the middle , so", "Project Manager: Well it's a bit hard , because we are going to be uh individually .", "Marketing: Nei . We're  No", "Project Manager: That's a bit uh", "Marketing: We're deciding now , so", "Project Manager: Yes .", "Marketing: Top or bottom ?", "Industrial Designer: Well uh yeah I I still think it's it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top , so", "Project Manager: Yes it is .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah . You say familiarity isn't important but", "Project Manager: Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ? Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ?", "Marketing: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah d Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah , right . Okay .", "Project Manager: Alright these functions .", "User Interface: Alright .", "Industrial Designer: As we we we we agreed , we do have a LCD .", "Project Manager: The number f Well yes , that's alright .", "Industrial Designer: So that's that's enough . Yeah .", "Marketing: Yeah , okay .", "Project Manager: W the number function . Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ?", "User Interface: No .", "Project Manager: How do you want it to do then ?", "User Interface: Well just when you push a one one and", "Industrial Designer: There's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero .", "Project Manager: It it has to r recognise one as  there could still come more .", "User Interface: No ,  if you  On most TVs if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other ,  d it", "Industrial Designer: Oh , like that . Um", "Project Manager: Yes .", "Industrial Designer: They'd recognise it .", "Project Manager: Alright so no button for that .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Th that's the most", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: That that's very easy . Yeah .", "Marketing: No .", "Project Manager: Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote ?", "Industrial Designer: I think these are the the most important functions .", "Marketing: Do you still have the pictures over there ?", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: So", "Marketing: Yeah , that's about it . You do need the uh multi Or did uh  No , like this one . You do need them ?", "Project Manager: No , we'd uh just said we didn't uh", "Marketing: Yeah , I know .", "Marketing: But are we", "Project Manager: Well uh", "Marketing: Alright , alright uh   Now okay .", "Project Manager: Um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant . So just for a television is that all we need ?", "Marketing: Right . Yeah , it's most useable this way .", "Industrial Designer: basic function .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Teletext is gone . So all those buttons that  ar are to do with teletext  Oh screen placing .", "Project Manager: We'll have uh those uh buttons about uh  And uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting .", "Project Manager: Uh there's um  screen . You can make it wider and less wide .", "Marketing: Yeah .", "Project Manager: And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video .", "Marketing: Right .", "Industrial Designer: Oh yeah .", "Marketing: I do think we have to put that underneath a clip .", "Project Manager: Those two ? But it's just two , and we make a clip ?", "Industrial Designer: Uh just two just two under uh under uh", "Project Manager: Th that's a bit uh waste .", "User Interface: We we can make  make uh a little row of like four buttons down here .", "Project Manager: Yes .", "Marketing: Yeah . Okay , right .", "Project Manager: Or at the top .", "Industrial Designer: I I think uh", "Project Manager: Your LCD screen is going to go .", "User Interface: Or at", "Industrial Designer: But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section .", "User Interface: Yeah alright then .", "Industrial Designer: Uh that's that's too complicated .", "Project Manager: Yes .", "Industrial Designer: You can just put it somewhere", "Project Manager: Yeah", "Industrial Designer: They they aren't used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere", "User Interface: Oh , they can be small or round like buttons .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah . Yeah or at the top , yeah . What do you think uh those those buttons ?", "Project Manager: Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote .", "Industrial Designer: Above or down ? And w where ? Well we design it later . We have it , and we design later where everything goes . Yeah .", "Project Manager: Yes ? Yes . Yes . Well any other uh", "Marketing: Well if you  you take those th If you", "User Interface: Why go to video ?", "Project Manager: Go to video , that's always on your remote control .

Yeah .", "Project Manager: Well l n no not at not at my remote .", "Industrial Designer: No no not always . Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah , but you can can zap down", "Marketing: Yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ .", "Project Manager: Yes . I don't .", "User Interface: Yes , I think th", "Project Manager: I go to ninety-nine .", "User Interface: No , then you press ninety nine .", "Marketing: Ah uh well whatever ,  .", "User Interface: I think go to video is an irrelevant button , but", "Project Manager: Th that's the button uh  No .", "Industrial Designer: But it's easy to go   If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero .", "Project Manager: No you can ch push zero .

Yeah ,", "Industrial Designer: It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button .", "Project Manager: I I think that one button is uh  I use it uh", "Marketing: Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , if you wa if you have a new TV .
