You know , there 's a zillion things that people might annotate this for . And the only thing that is really sort of common among all the versi the various versions of this data is the word sequence , or approximately .\", 'Postdoc E: Yep .', 'PhD F: Or the time .', \"PhD A: Or the times . But , see , if you 'd annotate dialogue acts , you don't necessarily want to  or topics  you don't really want to be dealing with time - marks .\", 'PhD F: I guess .', \"PhD A: You 'd  it 's much more efficient for them to just see the word sequence , right ?\", 'PhD F: Mm - hmm .', \"PhD A: I mean , most people aren't as sophisticated as  as we are here with , you know , uh , time alignments and stuff . So  So the  the  the point is\", 'Grad C: Should  should we mention some names on the people who are n ?', \"PhD A: Right . So , um , the p my point is that  you 're gonna end up with , uh , word sequences that are differently annotated . And  you want some tool , uh , that is able to sort of merge these different annotations back into a single , uh , version . OK ? Um , and we had this problem very massively , uh , at SRI when we worked , uh , a while back on ,  uh  well , on dialogue acts as well as , uh , you know , um , what was it ? uh ,\", 'PhD F: Well , all the Switchboard in it .', \"PhD A: utterance types . There 's , uh , automatic , uh , punctuation and stuff like that .\", 'PhD F: Yeah .', \"PhD A: Because we had one set of  annotations that were based on , uh , one version of the transcripts with a particular segmentation , and then we had another version that was based on , uh , a different s slightly edited version of the transcripts with a different segmentation . So ,  we had these two different versions which were  you know , you could tell they were from the same source but they weren't identical . So it was extremely hard  to reliably merge these two back together to correlate the information from the different annotations .\", \"Grad C: Yep . I  I don't see any way that file formats are gonna help us with that .\", 'PhD A: No .', \"Grad C: It 's  it 's all a question of semantic .\", 'PhD A: No . But once you have a file format , I can imagine writing  not personally , but someone writing a tool that is essentially an alignment tool , um , that mediates between various versions ,', 'PhD F: Mm - hmm .', 'Grad C: Yeah .', 'PhD A: and  uh , sort of like th uh , you know , you have this thing in UNIX where you have , uh , diff .', 'Grad C: Diff .', 'PhD F: W - diff or diff .', \"PhD A: There 's the , uh , diff that actually tries to reconcile different  two diffs f  based on the same original .\", 'PhD F: Yeah .', 'Postdoc E: Is it S - diff ?', 'Grad C: Yep .', 'Postdoc E: Mmm .', \"PhD A: Something like that , um , but operating on these lattices that are really what 's behind this  uh , this annotation format .\", 'Grad C: Yep .', 'PhD A: So', \"Grad C: There 's actually a diff library you can use  to do things like that that  so you have different formats .\", 'PhD F: You could definitely do that with the', 'PhD A: So somewhere in the API you would like to have like a merge or some  some function that merges two  two versions .', \"Grad C: Yeah , I think it 's gonna be very hard . Any sort of structured anything when you try to merge is really , really hard\", 'PhD A: Right .', 'Grad C: because you ha i The hard part isn\\'t the file format .

So if you have a good ,', 'Grad C: But this is exactly what I mean , is that  that the problem i', 'PhD F: um  Yeah . You just have to know wha what to tie it to .', 'Grad C: Yeah , exactly . The problem is saying \" what are the semantics ,', 'PhD F: And', 'Grad C: what do you mean by \" merge \" ? \"', 'PhD F: Right , right .', 'PhD A: Right . So  so just to let you know what we  where we kluged it by , uh , doing  uh , by doing  Hhh .', 'Grad C: So .', 'PhD A: Both were based on words , so , bo we have two versions of the same words intersp you know , sprinkled with  with different tags for annotations .', 'Grad C: And then you did diff .', 'PhD A: And we did diff . Exactly !', \"Grad C: Yeah , that 's just what I thought .\", \"PhD A: And that 's how\", \"Grad C: That 's just wh how I would have done it .\", 'PhD A: Yeah . But , you know , it had lots of errors and things would end up in the wrong order , and so forth . Uh , so , um , if you had a more', 'Grad C: Yep .', 'PhD A: Uh , it  it was a kluge because it was basically reducing everything to  uh , to  uh , uh , to textual alignment .', 'Grad C: A textual', 'PhD A: Um , so', \"PhD F: But , d isn't that something where whoever  if   if the people who are making changes , say in the transcripts , cuz this all happened when the transcripts were different  ye um , if they tie it to something , like if they tied it to the acoustic segment  if they  You know what I mean ? Then  Or if they tied it to an acoustic segment and we had the time - marks , that would help .\", 'Grad C: Yep .', \"PhD F: But the problem is exactly as Adam said , that you get , you know , y you don't have that information or it 's lost in the merge somehow ,\", 'Postdoc E: Well , can I ask one question ?', 'PhD F: so', \"Postdoc E: It  it seems to me that , um , we will have o an official version of the corpus , which will be only one  one version in terms of the words  where the words are concerned .

And , uh , s you know , several years from now you might want to look into , um , the prosody of referring expressions .

He  he 's a language modeling person , though .\", 'PhD A: Um', \"Grad C: So  so imagine  I think his  his example is a good one .

Yeah .', 'Grad C: He included references to words .', 'Postdoc E: Ach !', 'PhD A: Yeah .', 'Grad C: He said that at this word is when  when it happened .', 'Postdoc E: Well , then', 'PhD A: Or she .', 'Grad C: Or she .', \"Postdoc E: But then couldn't you just indirectly figure out the time  tied to the word ?\", 'PhD F: But still they  Exactly .', 'Grad C: Sure . But what if  what if they change the words ?', 'PhD F: Yeah .', \"Postdoc E: Not  Well , but you 'd have some anchoring point . He couldn't have changed all the words .\", 'PhD D: But can they change the words without changing the time of the word ?', \"Grad C: Sure . But they could have changed it a little . The  the point is , that  that they may have annotated it off a word transcript that isn't the same as our word transcript , so how do you merge it back in ?

You can merge at the level of the representation that the other person preserved and that 's it .\", \"Grad C: Right . And that 's about all you can do .\", 'PhD F: And beyond that , all you know is  is relative ordering and sometimes even that is wrong .', 'Grad C: So  so in  so in this one you would have to do a best match between the word sequences ,', 'PhD F: So .', 'PhD A: Mm - hmm .', 'Grad C: extract the times f from the best match of theirs to yours , and use that .', 'PhD F: And then infer that their time - marks are somewhere in between .', 'Grad C: Right .', 'PhD F: Yeah , exactly .', 'Postdoc E: But it could be that they just  uh , I mean , it could be that they chunked  they  they lost certain utterances and all that stuff ,', 'Grad C: Right , exactly .
